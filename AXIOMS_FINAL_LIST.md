# Complete Axiom Inventory - P≠NP Formalization
## Official List for Publication

**Project**: Formal Proof Architecture for P≠NP in Lean 4
**Revision Date**: 2025-10-24
**Total Active Axioms (`pnp3/`)**: 10
**Complexity Interface Axioms**: 0 (replaced by imported theorems)

## Executive Summary

The current `pnp3/` proof development depends on ten externally justified
statements.  They fall into three natural families:

| Category | Files | Axioms | Literature Anchor |
|----------|-------|--------|--------------------|
| Part A — Switching/Shrinkage | `ThirdPartyFacts/Facts_Switching.lean` | 2 | Håstad (1986), Williams (2014) |
| Part C — Anti-checker lower bounds | `LowerBounds/AntiChecker.lean` | 4 | Lipton–Young (1994), Chapman–Williams (2015), OPS (2019/2021) |
| Part D — Magnification triggers | `Magnification/Facts_Magnification.lean` | 4 | OPS (2019), CJW (2022) |

Every interface lemma in `pnp3/Complexity/Interfaces.lean` is now a theorem:
`P_subset_Ppoly_proof` and `P_ne_NP_of_nonuniform_separation` import concrete
proofs from the lightweight `Facts/PsubsetPpoly` package.

Archived copies of the older switching/magnification axioms remain in
`archive/` for historical reference but are not part of the active build.

## Detailed Catalogue

### Part A — Switching and Shrinkage (2 axioms)

1. **`partial_shrinkage_for_AC0`** — `pnp3/ThirdPartyFacts/Facts_Switching.lean`
   - Partial PDT certificate with explicit depth and error bounds.
   - Source: Håstad (1986), Servedio–Tan (2019).
2. **`shrinkage_for_localCircuit`** — same file, local-circuit variant.
   - Source: Williams (2014), Chen–Oliveira–Santhanam (2022).

### Part C — Anti-Checker Lower Bounds (4 axioms)

3. **`antiChecker_exists_large_Y`** — `pnp3/LowerBounds/AntiChecker.lean`
   - Exponential indistinguishable set against AC⁰ solvers.
4. **`antiChecker_exists_testset`** — same file
   - Supplies a polylogarithmic test set separating functions in `Y`.
5. **`antiChecker_exists_large_Y_local`** — local solver version.
6. **`antiChecker_exists_testset_local`** — local solver + test set.
   - Sources for 3–6: Lipton–Young (1994), Chapman–Williams (2015),
     Oliveira–Pich–Santhanam (2019/2021).

### Part D — Magnification Bridges (4 axioms)

7. **`OPS_trigger_general`** — `pnp3/Magnification/Facts_Magnification.lean`
   - General OPS trigger: lower-bound hypothesis ⇒ `NP_not_subset_Ppoly`.
8. **`OPS_trigger_formulas`** — same file
   - Formula-specific trigger for `N^{2+δ}` lower bounds.
9. **`Locality_trigger`** — same file
   - Local circuit barrier (`N·(log N)^κ`).
10. **`CJW_sparse_trigger`** — same file
    - CJW sparse-language trigger.
   - Sources: Oliveira–Pich–Santhanam (2019), Chapman–Jansen–Williams (2022).

## Complexity Interfaces (Proven)

- `@[simp] theorem P_subset_Ppoly_proof : P_subset_Ppoly`
- `theorem P_ne_NP_of_nonuniform_separation`

Both results are imported from `Facts/PsubsetPpoly` and carry full Lean proofs.
They replace the earlier axioms `P_subset_Ppoly` and
`P_ne_NP_of_nonuniform_separation` that existed in historical branches.

---

## Archived Axioms

Legacy files kept under `archive/` still mention the following axioms:

- `partial_shrinkage_with_oracles`
- `depth2_switching_probabilistic`
- `depth2_constructive_switching`
- Duplicate `P_subset_Ppoly` declarations in `ComplexityClasses.lean`
- `magnification_AC0_MCSP` and `FCE_implies_MCSP`

They are excluded from the active build and from the totals above.

## Change Log

- **2025-10-24** — Updated totals to 10 axioms, reclassified complexity
  interfaces as theorems, and documented retirement of depth-2 switching files.
