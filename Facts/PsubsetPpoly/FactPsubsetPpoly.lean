# External fact `P âŠ† P/poly`

This module exposes the lightweight interface defined in
`Proof/Complexity/Interfaces.lean`.  It imports the constructive bridge
`Proof/Complexity/PsubsetPpoly.lean` so we re-export the actual proof of the
inclusion rather than postulating it as an axiom.  Downstream projects can
depend on the named statement without pulling in any additional
infrastructure.
