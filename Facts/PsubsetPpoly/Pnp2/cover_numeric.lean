/-!  The original development left the numeric cover bounds abstract.
    This file now derives a simple numeric bound from `familyEntropyCover`.
    The definitions remain noncomputable, but they no longer collapse to
    trivial constants.  Future work will refine these quantities further.

/--
`minCoverSize F h hH hn_pos` is the size of the cover returned by
`familyEntropyCover` when the family has collision entropy at most `h`.
The witness cover is obtained via classical choice, so the definition is
noncomputable but entirely constructive.

noncomputable def minCoverSize (F : Family N) (h : ℕ)
    (hH : H₂ F ≤ (h : ℝ))
    (hn_pos : 0 < N) : ℕ :=
  (Boolcube.familyEntropyCover (F := F) (h := h) hH hn_pos).rects.card

/--
Basic entropy-based bound on `minCoverSize`.  The cover extracted from
`familyEntropyCover` obeys the explicit `mBound` estimate, provided the
arithmetic inequality `hM` is available.  This coarse bound suffices for the
numerical considerations in this module.

    minCoverSize F (h := N - Nδ) h₀ hn_pos ≤ mBound N (N - Nδ) := by
  classical
  -- The bound is provided directly by `familyEntropyCover`.
  simpa [minCoverSize] using
    (Boolcube.familyEntropyCover (F := F) (h := N - Nδ) h₀ hn_pos).bound

/-- Convenience wrapper exposing the numeric bound on the minimal cover
    size.  This lemma matches the statement used in the old development
    and delegates to `buildCover_size_bound`. -/
lemma minCoverSize_bound
    (h₀ : H₂ F ≤ (N - Nδ : ℝ))
    (hn_pos : 0 < N) :
    minCoverSize F (h := N - Nδ) h₀ hn_pos ≤ mBound N (N - Nδ) :=
  buildCover_size_bound (F := F) (Nδ := Nδ)
    (h₀ := h₀) (hn_pos := hn_pos)

/--
Simple numeric bound on `minCoverSize` without the dimension positivity
assumption.  The bound is immediate when `N = 0`, otherwise we reuse
`minCoverSize_bound` with the derived positivity proof.

    (h₀ := h₀) (hn_pos := hn_pos)

/-!  `buildCover_card n` denotes the size of the cover returned by the
experimental algorithm on families of dimension `n`.  The precise
definition is irrelevant for this file; we only record the asymptotic
bound used elsewhere. -/

/--  Cardinality placeholder for the experimental cover at dimension `n`.
    The actual cover construction is not implemented yet; we expose the
    conservative upper bound `2^n` as a stand‑in to support asymptotic
    statements and tests. This will be replaced by the exact cardinality
    once the recursive algorithm is implemented. -/
noncomputable def buildCover_card (n : ℕ) : ℕ := Nat.pow 2 n

/--
`buildCover_card` is defined as the trivial bound `2^n`, so it obviously
does not exceed this quantity.  In the original development this fact was
stated as an axiom; here we provide the straightforward proof instead. -/

  simpa [buildCover_card]

/--  The coarse bound above is, by construction, dominated by the
    exponential function `2^n`.  Stating the result using big‑O notation
    keeps the interface stable as the cover algorithm evolves. -/
