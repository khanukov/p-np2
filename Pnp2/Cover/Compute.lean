This module provides a small **executable interface** for the cover
construction.  The long‑term goal of the project is an efficient algorithm that
enumerates a modest collection of monochromatic subcubes covering all
`1`‑inputs of a family of Boolean functions.  The sophisticated machinery for
that algorithm lives in `cover2.lean` and its companion files and is still
under active development.

Historically this file exposed a tiny enumerator `buildCoverNaive` that scanned
the entire Boolean cube and recorded every point on which *all* functions
evaluate to `true`.  Each such point became a zero‑dimensional subcube.  While
simple, this approach is exponentially slow and therefore only suitable as a
temporary stand‑in.

We now define `buildCoverCompute` as a thin wrapper around the (currently
stubbed) recursive construction `Cover2.buildCover`.  Once the latter is fully
implemented, `buildCoverCompute` will automatically pick up the improved
behaviour while keeping a compact API for external users.

`Cover.Bounds` exposes the auxiliary function `mBound` together with several
useful arithmetic lemmas.  We re-export the most common ones so that users of
this module can reason about bounds without importing the full development.

`buildCoverNaive` is a tiny executable baseline for the cover construction.
It scans all points of the Boolean cube and records those on which **every**
function in the family evaluates to `true`.  Each such point becomes a
zero‑dimensional subcube.  The procedure is exponentially slow in `n` but keeps
the code entirely constructive and provides a convenient playground while the
efficient algorithm is being developed.

Basic specification for `buildCoverNaive`.
The resulting list has no duplicates, every listed cube is monochromatic for
the family (with colour `true`) and the length never exceeds the number of
available subcubes.

`buildCoverCompute` is the executable interface exposed to external users.  It
delegates to the recursive construction `Cover2.buildCover` and converts the
resulting finite set of rectangles into a list.  The entropy budget `h` and the
proof `hH` are currently unused but will become relevant once the underlying
algorithm is fully implemented.

Specification for `buildCoverCompute`.  The resulting list has no duplicates,
every listed subcube is monochromatic for the family and the length never
exceeds the number of available subcubes.  The statement mirrors
`buildCoverNaive_spec` but keeps the interface in terms of the entropy budget.
