This lightweight module provides a purely constructive wrapper around the
heavy `cover` development.  To keep the test suite compiling we include only
the definitions needed by `Algorithms.SatCover` and postpone the actual proof
details.  The implementation will eventually mirror `Cover.buildCover`, but
for now we expose a stub version accompanied by admitted specifications.

`buildCoverCompute` is a constructive cover enumerator used by the SAT procedure.
It enumerates the rectangles produced by `Cover.coverFamily`, turning the finite set into an explicit list.

Basic specification for `buildCoverCompute`. It simply expands `Cover.coverFamily` into a list,
so the rectangles remain monochromatic and the length bound follows from `coverFamily_card_bound`.
