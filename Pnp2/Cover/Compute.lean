This module provides an **executable baseline** for the cover construction.

The long‑term goal of the project is an efficient algorithm that enumerates a
small collection of monochromatic subcubes covering all `1`‑inputs of a family
of Boolean functions.  The sophisticated machinery for that algorithm lives in
`cover2.lean` and its companion files but is still under active development.

To keep the experimental interface usable we currently expose a very simple
enumerator `buildCoverCompute`.  It merely scans the entire Boolean cube and
records every point on which *all* functions evaluate to `true`.  Each such
point becomes a zero‑dimensional subcube, providing a tiny yet fully
constructive cover.  Although this procedure is exponentially slow and far from
the eventual strategy, it offers a convenient playground for experimentation
and keeps the public API stable.

`Cover.Bounds` exposes the auxiliary function `mBound` together with several
useful arithmetic lemmas.  We re-export the most common ones so that users of
this module can reason about bounds without importing the full development.

`buildCoverNaive` is a tiny executable baseline for the cover construction.
It scans all points of the Boolean cube and records those on which **every**
function in the family evaluates to `true`.  Each such point becomes a
zero‑dimensional subcube.  The procedure is exponentially slow in `n` but keeps
the code entirely constructive and provides a convenient playground while the
efficient algorithm is being developed.

Basic specification for `buildCoverNaive`.
The resulting list has no duplicates, every listed cube is monochromatic for
the family (with colour `true`) and the length never exceeds the number of
available subcubes.

`buildCoverCompute` is the executable interface exposed to external users.
For the moment it simply delegates to `buildCoverNaive`, ignoring the entropy
budget.  The parameters `h` and `hH` are retained to keep the signature stable
for future refinements when a more sophisticated algorithm becomes available.

Specification for `buildCoverCompute`.  The resulting list has no duplicates,
every listed subcube is monochromatic for the family and the length never
exceeds the number of available subcubes.  The statement mirrors
`buildCoverNaive_spec` but keeps the interface in terms of the entropy budget.
