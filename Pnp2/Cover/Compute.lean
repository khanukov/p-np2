This lightweight module provides a purely constructive wrapper around the
heavy `cover` development.  To keep the test suite compiling we include only
the definitions needed by `Algorithms.SatCover` and postpone the actual proof
details.  The implementation will eventually mirror `Cover.buildCover`, but
for now we expose a stub version accompanied by admitted specifications.

`buildCoverCompute` is a constructive cover enumerator used by the SAT
procedure.  The current implementation is a placeholder that returns an
empty list; the full algorithm will mirror `Cover.buildCover`.

Specification of `buildCoverCompute`.  The rectangles cover all positive
inputs of the family, are monochromatic, and the list length is bounded by
`mBound`.  These properties are admitted for now.
