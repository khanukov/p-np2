This file intentionally provides only a **tiny computational stub** for the
cover construction.  The heavy combinatorial machinery lives elsewhere; here we
only expose a minimal API that is sufficient for the test suite and downstream
experiments to compile.

For the time being `buildCoverCompute` does not attempt to compute a genuine
cover.  It simply returns the empty list of rectangles.  This keeps the
implementation trivially executable while we gradually fill in the real
algorithm.  The specification below reflects this placeholder behaviour.

`Cover.Bounds` exposes the auxiliary function `mBound` together with several
useful arithmetic lemmas.  We re-export the most common ones so that users of
this module can reason about bounds without importing the full development.

Trivial computational cover.  Given a family `F` and an entropy budget `h`,
`buildCoverCompute F h` returns the empty list of rectangles.  This is merely a
placeholder for the future constructive implementation.

Basic specification for the stub `buildCoverCompute`: all listed rectangles are
monochromatic for the family (vacuously, since the list is empty) and the
enumeration length satisfies the global bound `mBound`.
