This module provides a **lightweight executable wrapper** for the cover
construction.  The eventual goal is to expose the full constructive algorithm
developed in the theory files.  As an incremental step we currently employ a
very simple baseline procedure `buildCoverNaive` that scans the entire Boolean
cube and records all points that evaluate to `true` for every function in the
family.

The main interface `buildCoverCompute` is a thin wrapper around this baseline
algorithm.  It retains parameters for the entropy budget `h` and its proof
`hH` so that a more sophisticated implementation can be plugged in later
without changing callers.  The present module therefore offers an executable,
if highly inefficient, cover construction that nevertheless satisfies the
same basic specification as the future algorithm.

`Cover.Bounds` exposes the auxiliary function `mBound` together with several
useful arithmetic lemmas.  We re-export the most common ones so that users of
this module can reason about bounds without importing the full development.

`buildCoverNaive` is a tiny executable baseline for the cover construction.
It scans all points of the Boolean cube and records those on which **every**
function in the family evaluates to `true`.  Each such point becomes a
zero‑dimensional subcube.  The procedure is exponentially slow in `n` but keeps
the code entirely constructive and provides a convenient playground while the
efficient algorithm is being developed.

Basic specification for `buildCoverNaive`.
The resulting list has no duplicates, every listed cube is monochromatic for
the family (with colour `true`) and the length never exceeds the number of
available subcubes.

`buildCoverCompute` exposes the current executable cover algorithm.  At this
stage it simply delegates to `buildCoverNaive`, a straightforward enumeration of
all points where every function in the family evaluates to `true`.  The entropy
budget `h` is ignored for now; the parameter is kept so that future, more
efficient implementations can drop in without changing the public interface.

/--
Basic specification for `buildCoverCompute`.  The resulting list is free of
duplicates, every listed cube is monochromatic for the family and the length is
bounded by the total number of subcubes.  This mirrors
`buildCoverNaive_spec` while keeping the intended future interface.
