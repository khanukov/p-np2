This lightweight module provides a purely constructive wrapper around the
heavy `cover` development.  To keep the test suite compiling we include only
the definitions needed by `Algorithms.SatCover` and postpone the actual proof
details.  The implementation will eventually mirror `Cover.buildCover`, but
for now we expose a stub version accompanied by admitted specifications.

`buildCoverCompute` is a constructive cover enumerator used by the SAT
procedure.  The current implementation is a placeholder that returns an
empty list; the full algorithm will mirror `Cover.buildCover`.

/--
Basic specification for `buildCoverCompute`.  The current implementation
simply returns the empty list, so every rectangle is vacuously monochromatic
for the family and the length bound holds trivially.  Once the full algorithm
is implemented this lemma will be strengthened accordingly.
