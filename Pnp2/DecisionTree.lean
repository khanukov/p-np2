The number of leaf subcubes is bounded by `2 ^ depth`. This follows from
`leaf_count_le_pow_depth` by unfolding the `leaves_as_subcubes` definition

included here so that the legacy `Pnp2` library exposes the same API as the

/-! ### Path-based family restrictions -/

namespace Family

variable {n : ℕ}

/--
Restrict every function in a family according to a path of fixed coordinates.
Each pair `(i, b)` in the list records that coordinate `i` is set to `b`.
Later occurrences in the path override earlier ones, mirroring
`DecisionTree.subcube_of_path` behaviour. -/
noncomputable def restrictPath (F : Family n) : List (Fin n × Bool) → Family n
  | []        => F
  | (i, b) :: p => (restrictPath F p).restrict i b

@[simp] lemma restrictPath_nil (F : Family n) :
    restrictPath F [] = F := rfl

@[simp] lemma restrictPath_cons (F : Family n) (i : Fin n) (b : Bool)
    (p : List (Fin n × Bool)) :
    restrictPath F ((i, b) :: p) = (restrictPath F p).restrict i b := rfl

/-!  Concatenating paths corresponds to sequentially applying the
    restrictions.  This helper lemma unfolds the recursion and shows
    that processing `p ++ q` is the same as first restricting by `q`
    and then by `p`. -/
lemma restrictPath_append (F : Family n) (p q : List (Fin n × Bool)) :
    restrictPath F (p ++ q) = restrictPath (restrictPath F q) p := by
  induction p with
  | nil =>
      simp [restrictPath]
  | cons hd tl ih =>
      cases hd with
      | mk i b =>
          simp [List.cons_append, restrictPath, ih]

/-- Restricting along a path does not increase sensitivity.  This follows by
iterating `sensitivity_family_restrict_le`. -/
lemma sensitivity_restrictPath_le (F : Family n) (p : List (Fin n × Bool))
    {s : ℕ} [Fintype (Point n)] (Hs : ∀ f ∈ F, sensitivity f ≤ s) :
    ∀ g ∈ restrictPath F p, sensitivity g ≤ s := by
  induction p with
  | nil =>
      simpa using Hs
  | cons q p ih =>
      cases q with

          have hg' : g ∈ (restrictPath F p).restrict i b := by simpa using hg
          have htail := sensitivity_family_restrict_le
            (F := restrictPath F p) (i := i) (b := b) (s := s) (hF := ih)
