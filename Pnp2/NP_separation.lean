# Non-uniform Separation and `P ≠ NP`

This file records the axioms that connect an improved lower bound on
`MCSP` with the classical complexity-theoretic separations.  At this
stage we keep the magnification theorem and the bridge from the
constructive cover as assumptions, but we eliminate the historical
dependence on the Karp–Lipton collapse.  Instead we spell out the
elementary deduction that combines a non-uniform separation with the
classical inclusion `P ⊆ P/poly` to conclude `P ≠ NP`.

/-- A stub representing the claim that `MCSP` requires circuits of size
    at least `n^{1 + ε}` and depth `o(log n)` within `ACC⁰`.  The actual
    numeric bounds are omitted here. -/
constant MCSP_lower_bound : ℝ → Prop

/-- Hypothesis: magnification for `ACC⁰` circuits on `MCSP`.  If the
    lower bound holds for some `ε > 0`, then `NP` is not contained in
    `P/poly`. -/
axiom magnification_AC0_MCSP :
  (∃ ε > 0, MCSP_lower_bound ε) → NP ⊄ Ppoly

### From `NP ⊄ P/poly` to `P ≠ NP`

The only classical ingredient we need at the moment is the well-known
simulation of polynomial-time Turing machines by polynomial-size
circuits.  Once this inclusion is available, any separation between `NP`
and `P/poly` immediately forces `P` to differ from `NP`.
-/

/-- A helper lemma isolating the purely set-theoretic argument: if `NP`
    is not contained in `P/poly` but `P` is, then `P ≠ NP`.  The proof
    is elementary and keeps the final chain free of any reference to the
    polynomial hierarchy. -/

/-!  Simple illustration showing that the statement
`P_ne_NP_of_MCSP_bound` yields `P ≠ NP` whenever an MCSP lower bound is
available.  The proof mirrors the legacy version and serves as a
sanity check for the migrated lemmas. -/

/-!  Bridge from the constructive cover (FCE-Lemma) to the MCSP lower
bound.  In the current blueprint this implication is assumed as an
axiom.  Ported from the legacy development for completeness. -/

/-- Assuming the bridge from the FCE-Lemma to the MCSP lower bound, we
    obtain the classical separation `P ≠ NP` without appealing to the
    polynomial hierarchy. -/
