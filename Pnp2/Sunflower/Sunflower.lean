/-! ### Factorial decomposition over iterated erasures -/

/-- **Factorial decomposition of iterated slices.**

    Let `𝓢` be a `w`-uniform family and `xs` a list of elements to be
    erased one by one.  As long as the remaining width `w - xs.length` is
    positive, the following identity holds:

    \[
      (w - |xs|)! \cdot |familyAfter 𝓢 xs|
        = \sum_{x \in (familyAfter 𝓢 xs).unions}
            (w - |xs| - 1)! \cdot |familyAfter 𝓢 (x :: xs)|.
    \]

    Intuitively, each set in `familyAfter 𝓢 xs` has `w - xs.length`
    elements.  Expanding the factorial of this width and applying the
    double-counting lemma `sum_card_slices_eq_w_mul_card` yields the
    stated equality. -/

/-- **Greedy slice bound: existence of a large next-step family.**

Given a `w`-uniform family `𝓢` and a list `xs` of already erased elements,
assume the remaining width `w - xs.length` is positive and the current family
`familyAfter 𝓢 xs` is nonempty.  Then there exists an element `x` in the union
of the current family such that the next-step family `familyAfter 𝓢 (x :: xs)`
has cardinality at least the average value predicted by the factorial
decomposition.

The bound is written in a slightly algebraic form using `Nat.div`; it says
that the maximal slice is at least the average slice size. -/
