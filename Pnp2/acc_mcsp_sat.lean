-- ==================
--
-- Outline of the meet-in-the-middle SAT algorithm for `ACC⁰ ∘ MCSP`.
-- This module gathers a few definitions and lemma stubs that would
-- connect the cover from the Family Collision–Entropy Lemma
-- (Lemma B) with a subexponential SAT algorithm.
-- All statements are currently placeholders and the proofs are omitted.

    a rectangular cover of the MCSP truth tables.  The algorithm loops
    over the rectangles and computes partial sums on the left and right
    halves.  Whenever a non‑zero product is detected the circuit is
    satisfiable.  This stub merely returns `false`. -/
