===========

Top‑level **cover construction** for the Family Collision‑Entropy Lemma.
The next step in the formalization introduces real "uncovered input"
structures and an *optional* search for the first uncovered ⟨f, x⟩.
`buildCover` now recurses on these data.  The entropy-based branch is
implemented via `exists_coord_entropy_drop` and decreases `H₂` both in
the chosen branch and in its complement.  Only the sunflower branch and
the final numeric bound remain open.
