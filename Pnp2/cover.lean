===========

Top‑level **cover construction** for the Family Collision‑Entropy Lemma.
The next step in the formalization introduces real "uncovered input"
structures and an *optional* search for the first uncovered ⟨f, x⟩.
`buildCover` now recurses on these data.  The entropy-based branch is
implemented via `exists_coord_entropy_drop` and decreases `H₂` both in
the chosen branch and in its complement.  Only the sunflower branch and
the final numeric bound remain open.

/-! ## Basic properties of `buildCover` -/

/--
`buildCover_mono` states that every subcube produced by `buildCover` is
monochromatic for the whole family.  The full proof proceeds by well-founded
induction on the recursion tree.  The low-sensitivity branch inserts cubes
from `low_sensitivity_cover`, the sunflower branch inserts one monochromatic
cube and recurses on fewer uncovered pairs, and the entropy branch applies the
induction hypothesis to the restricted families.

`buildCover_mono` states that every subcube produced by `buildCover` is
monochromatic for the whole family.  The proof follows the same well-founded
induction as `buildCover_covers`.  Each branch either inserts a collection of
subcubes produced by `low_sensitivity_cover`, a single sunflower subcube, or
recurses on families with strictly smaller measures.  We provide the
statement here together with a proof outline; completing the detailed argument
is left as future work.

`buildCover_card_bound` bounds the size of the cover returned by
`buildCover` in terms of the entropy budget `h`.  A double induction on `h` and the number of uncovered pairs shows that at most `2^h` cubes are produced.
The argument follows the same branch analysis as `buildCover_mono` and repeatedly applies the induction hypotheses.  We outline the reasoning here and leave a full proof to future work.
