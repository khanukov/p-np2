namespace Cover2

/-!  This module gradually reimplements the original `cover.lean` file.
Most numeric and combinatorial lemmas have already been ported, while the
recursive cover construction is currently represented by a lightweight stub.
Remaining gaps are tracked in `docs/cover_migration_plan.md`.

The heavy arithmetic lemmas surrounding the auxiliary function `mBound` live in
`Pnp2.Cover.Bounds`, while a coarse estimate on uncovered pairs resides in
`Pnp2.Cover.CoarseBound`.  This separation keeps the present file focused on the
combinatorial aspects of the cover construction.

The forthcoming `sunflower_step` lemma relies on the fact that the functions
selected from a sunflower behave identically on any two points that agree on the
core.  In the original development this follows from a combinatorial argument;
until that proof is ported we expose the required behaviour as an explicit
hypothesis.  The next lemma shows that such an agreement property forces the
support of the function to lie inside the core.

`CoreClosed` families become monochromatic on the subcube obtained by freezing a
large enough set of coordinates.  Concretely, if all functions of `F` evaluate
to `true` on the witness point `x₀` and the sunflower core contains at least
`n - ℓ` coordinates, then every point agreeing with `x₀` on the core is also a
`true`-input for all functions of `F`.

`sunflower_step` extracts a small subcube on which many functions of the family
are forced to evaluate to `true`.  The statement mirrors the classical lemma
from the original `cover` module: if all functions in `F` share the same non‑zero
support size `p` and the family of supports is large enough, a subcube of
positive dimension hosts `t` functions that are constantly `true`.

The argument below follows the combinatorial skeleton of the classical proof.
The additional `CoreClosed` assumption provides the missing control: once the
sunflower core contains at least `n - ℓ` coordinates, every function in the
family is forced to evaluate to `true` on the subcube determined by that core.
Instead of postulating that all functions agree on the all-`false` input we work
with an explicit finite set `Pts` of common `1`-inputs.  This matches the
construction in the cover recursion, where the sunflower step operates on a
nonempty pool of uncovered witnesses.
