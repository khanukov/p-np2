namespace Cover2

/-!  This module gradually reimplements the original `cover.lean` file.
Most numeric and combinatorial lemmas have already been ported, while the
recursive cover construction is currently represented by a lightweight stub.
Remaining gaps are tracked in `docs/cover_migration_plan.md`.

The heavy arithmetic lemmas surrounding the auxiliary function `mBound` live in
`Pnp2.Cover.Bounds`, while a coarse estimate on uncovered pairs resides in
`Pnp2.Cover.CoarseBound`.  This separation keeps the present file focused on the
combinatorial aspects of the cover construction.

The forthcoming `sunflower_step` lemma relies on the fact that the functions
selected from a sunflower behave identically on any two points that agree on the
core.  The original development establishes this combinatorially, but the
argument has not yet been ported to the present `Subcube` framework.  To keep the
migration moving we record the missing reasoning as an axiom; a future revision
will replace it with a genuine proof.

If two Boolean points coincide on the core of a sunflower and a Boolean function
has support contained in that core, then the function evaluates identically on
the two points.  This lemma isolates a general evaluation principle used in
`sunflower_step`.

`sunflower_step` extracts a small subcube on which many functions of the family
are forced to evaluate to `true`.  The statement mirrors the classical lemma
from the original `cover` module: if all functions in `F` share the same non‑zero
support size `p` and the family of supports is large enough, a subcube of
positive dimension hosts `t` functions that are constantly `true`.

The argument below follows the combinatorial skeleton of the classical proof.
We rely on the axiom `petal_agree_on_core` to encapsulate the missing reasoning
showing that the selected functions depend only on the sunflower core.  For the
time being we additionally assume that every function evaluates to `true` on the
all‑`false` input; once the combinatorial argument is fully ported this extra
hypothesis will become redundant.

`buildCover_card_bound_lowSens_or` partially bridges the gap towards the
full counting lemma `buildCover_card_bound`.  When the maximum sensitivity of
functions in the family falls below the logarithmic threshold we invoke the
low‑sensitivity bound.  Otherwise we fall back to the coarse measure argument
used in the general placeholder proof.  In the stubbed development the cover is
always empty, so the result reduces to the numeric inequality `0 ≤ mBound n h`.

In the low-sensitivity regime, `buildCover` produces a collection of

the statement from `cover.lean` and will gain substance once the recursive
construction is ported.

If the starting set of rectangles already covers all `1`-inputs of the

`mu_union_buildCover_le` is a small helper lemma used in termination
arguments for `buildCover`.  Adding the rectangles produced by one
step of the construction can only decrease the measure `μ`, since the
set of uncovered pairs shrinks.  With the current stub implementation of
`buildCover` this is immediate.

`mu_buildCover_lt_start` is a weak variant of the legacy lemma with the same
name.  In the original development the cover construction strictly decreased
the measure whenever an uncovered pair existed.  The current stubbed
implementation leaves the rectangle set unchanged, so we can only conclude that
the measure does not increase.  The strict inequality will return once the full
algorithm is ported.

`mu_union_buildCover_lt` mirrors the corresponding lemma from the

rectangles produced by `buildCover` would strictly decrease the measure
whenever `firstUncovered` returns a pair.  The current stubbed
implementation leaves the rectangle set unchanged, so we can only show
that the measure does not increase.  The strict version will return once
the full recursion is ported. -/

`buildCover_measure_drop` bounds the initial measure by `2 * h`.  In the

`cover_exists` packages the properties of `buildCover` into an existence
statement.  When the starting family has no uncovered `1`‑inputs, the stub

for downstream files to transition once the real construction is ported. -/
