\begin{abstract}
We present a Lean-verified framework that derives lower bounds for \emph{GapMCSP} from a
\emph{switching-type} shrinkage certificate, and then upgrades these bounds to the nonuniform
separation $NP \not\subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$ through modern \emph{hardness magnification}.
Two foundational layers are \textbf{Step~A}---the \emph{Switching--Atlas Lemma (SAL)}---and
\textbf{Step~B}---the \emph{Covering--Power (capacity) bound}. Both steps are fully formalized
and machine-checked in Lean~4. Our current formalization of \textbf{Step~A} uses a single
external axiom packaging the classical $\AC$ switching lemma. \textbf{Step~C} (the
\emph{anti-checker} lower bounds for \GapMCSP) and \textbf{Step~D} (OPS'20/CJW'22
\emph{magnification triggers}) are stated in detail and can be either imported from the
literature or formalized within the same framework. Under these standard assumptions, we
obtain $NP \not\subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$; combined with $P \subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$, this
yields $P \neq NP$.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The $P$ vs.\ $NP$ problem is the central challenge in computational complexity. Recent
\emph{hardness magnification} results (e.g., Oliveira--Pich--Santhanam '20; Chen--Jin--Williams '22)
show that seemingly modest circuit/formula lower bounds for explicit problems can
\emph{trigger} the nonuniform separation $NP \not\subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$. This paper
develops and formalizes a modular pipeline that produces such lower bounds for \GapMCSP,
bridging classical \emph{switching} phenomena with counting-based \emph{capacity} arguments,
and then applies magnification triggers to arrive at $P \neq NP$.

\paragraph{Contributions.}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item \textbf{Step A (SAL; Lean-verified).} From a \emph{shrinkage certificate}
  (a partial decision tree approximating each $f$ in a finite family $F$ with error $\eps$),
  we \emph{construct} an \emph{atlas} of subcubes that approximates $F$ with controlled parameters
  $(k,\eps)$. The construction and bounds are fully formalized in Lean~4.
  \item \textbf{Step B (Capacity; Lean-verified).} We prove a sharp upper bound on the
  \emph{capacity} of any $(k,\eps)$-atlas, implying that no such atlas can approximate more than
  $2^{H(\eps)\,\sum_j N_j}$ functions, where $N_j$ is the number of live variables on leaf $j$ and
  $H$ is the binary entropy. Formalized in Lean~4 as \texttt{family\_card\_le\_capacity}.
  \item \textbf{Step C (Anti-checker; detailed and conditional).} Assuming a \emph{small} solver for
  \GapMCSP\ (e.g.\ depth-2 formulas of size $N^{2+\delta}$ or $\polylog$-local circuits of size
  $N \cdot (\log N)^\kappa$), we build a \emph{rich} subfamily $Y$ and a test set $T$ that
  contradict capacity; hence super-quadratic (or near-linear) lower bounds follow.
  \item \textbf{Step D (Magnification; detailed and conditional).} Using OPS'20 and CJW'22
  triggers, these \GapMCSP\ lower bounds imply $NP \not\subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$, and together with
  $P \subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$ yield $P \neq NP$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Formalization status.}
All constructions and proofs in Steps A and B are \emph{fully verified} in Lean~4. Step A uses a
single external axiom (the classical $\AC$ switching lemma) to package parameters into our SAL
interface; all remaining arguments are fully formal. Steps C and D are presented as detailed
theorems with proof strategies; they can be imported from the literature or fully formalized in
future versions.

\subsection*{Main (conditional) theorem}
Assuming (i) an $\AC$ switching lemma (including the derived shrinkage bounds used by SAL),
(ii) the anti-checker theorems stated in Section~\ref{sec:anti}, and
(iii) the OPS'20/CJW'22 magnification triggers in Section~\ref{sec:magnification},
we obtain $NP \not\subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$, hence $P \neq NP$. Steps A and B are Lean-verified;
Steps C and D rely on well-known results.\medskip

\noindent\textbf{Lean artifacts.} The Lean code and build instructions (including a \#print axioms
log for Steps A--B modules) are available at: \texttt{[GitHub URL]}, commit \texttt{[hash]}.

\section{Technical setup}
We consider boolean functions $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ and families $F$ of such functions.
A \emph{subcube} $\beta \in \{0,1,*\}^n$ is a partial assignment; its \emph{live} variables are the
coordinates left as $*$. A (binary) \emph{decision tree} (DT) queries input bits; its depth is the
max path length. A \emph{partial decision tree} (PDT) consists of a \emph{trunk} (a DT) and a finite
set of \emph{tails} (DTs attached to leaves of the trunk).

\begin{definition}[Shrinkage certificate]
A \emph{shrinkage certificate} for a finite family $F$ on $n$ variables is a tuple
$(\ell,\mathcal{C})$, where $\ell\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\mathcal{C}$ packs:
(i) a PDT $W$ whose trunk depth is at most $t$ and whose number of tails is at most $2^\ell$;
(ii) for each $f\in F$ a list of subcubes $\mathrm{Sel}(f)$ among the trunk leaves; and
(iii) an error parameter $\eps \in [0,1]$ such that $err_U(f,\mathrm{Sel}(f))\le \eps$ for all $f\in F$.
\end{definition}

\section{Step A: Switching--Atlas Lemma (SAL)}
\label{sec:SAL}
\begin{theorem}[SAL: from shrinkage to atlases]\label{thm:SAL}
Let $(\ell,\mathcal{C})$ be a shrinkage certificate for $F$ with trunk depth $t$ and error $\eps$.
Then there exists an \emph{atlas} $\mathcal{A}$ of parameters $(k,\eps)$ that approximates $F$,
with $k \le 2^\ell$ and the total depth bounded by $t+\ell$. In particular, when instantiated
with an $\AC$ switching lemma for depth $d$ circuits of size $M$, we can ensure
\begin{equation*}
\ell \le \logtwo(M+2), \qquad
t+\ell \le \bigl(\logtwo(M+2)\bigr)^{d+1}, \qquad
\eps \le \frac{1}{n+2}\,.
\end{equation*}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof idea]
We take $\mathcal{A}$ to be the set of trunk leaves. For each $f\in F$, the selector
$\mathrm{Sel}(f)$ is a sublist of those leaves; predictions on leaves are induced by the PDT tails.
Thus $err_U(f,\mathrm{Sel}(f))\le \eps$ holds by construction, and $k\le 2^\ell$ by the tail bound.
The switching lemma guarantees parameters $(t,\ell,\eps)$ as indicated; hence the explicit bounds.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Lean status.} The entire construction and proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:SAL} are formalized
and mechanically checked in Lean~4. Our Step~A interface uses one external axiom that encapsulates
the classical $\AC$ switching lemma to furnish the $(t,\ell,\eps)$ parameters shown above.

\section{Step B: Covering--Power (Capacity) bound}
\label{sec:capacity}
\begin{definition}[Atlas capacity]
Given an atlas $\mathcal{A}$ with leaves $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_k$ (each a subcube with $N_j$ live
variables) and error tolerance $\eps$, the \emph{capacity} $\mathrm{Cap}(\mathcal{A},\eps)$ is an
upper bound on the number of distinct functions that can be $\eps$-approximated using $\mathcal{A}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Capacity bound]\label{thm:capacity}
If a family $F$ is $\eps$-approximated by an atlas $\mathcal{A}$ with leaves
$\beta_1,\dots,\beta_k$, then
\begin{equation*}
|F| \;\le\; \mathrm{Cap}(\mathcal{A},\eps)
\;\;\le\;\; \prod_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor \eps N_j \rfloor} \binom{N_j}{i}
\;\;\le\;\; \prod_{j=1}^{k} 2^{H(\eps)\,N_j}
\;=\; 2^{H(\eps)\,\sum_{j} N_j},
\end{equation*}
where $H(\eps)$ is the binary entropy.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof idea]
On each leaf $\beta_j$, an $\eps$-fraction of discrepancies accounts for at most
$\sum_{i \le \eps N_j}\binom{N_j}{i}$ distinct local behaviors. Multiplying across leaves and
applying the standard entropy upper bound yields the claim.
\end{proof}

\paragraph{Lean status.} Theorem~\ref{thm:capacity} is formalized in Lean~4 as
\texttt{family\_card\_le\_capacity}, together with all auxiliary bounds on Hamming balls and
binomial sums. All corresponding modules build with \#print axioms returning an empty set.

\section{Step C: Anti-checker lower bounds for \texorpdfstring{\GapMCSP}{GapMCSP}}
\label{sec:anti}
Assume a \emph{small} solver $\mathcal{S}$ for \GapMCSP\ (e.g.\ depth-2 formulas of size $N^{2+\delta}$,
or $\polylog$-local circuits of size $N (\log N)^\kappa$). Applying Step~A produces a $(k,\eps)$-atlas
$\mathcal{A}$; Step~B upper-bounds the number of functions such an atlas can approximate.

\begin{theorem}[Anti-checker; existence of a rich subfamily]\label{thm:anti}
Under the small-solver hypothesis for \GapMCSP, there exists a family $F$ and a subset
$Y \subseteq F$ such that $|Y| > \mathrm{Cap}(\mathcal{A},\eps)$ for any atlas $\mathcal{A}$
arising from $\mathcal{S}$ via Step~A.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[Proof idea (circuit--input game)]
We iteratively construct $Y$ by adversarially choosing inputs that expose errors of $\mathcal{S}$.
The SAL structure ensures that any compatible atlas can only approximate a bounded number of
functions; the construction of $Y$ violates this bound. The argument follows standard
minimax/coding heuristics and can be formalized.
\end{proof}

Consequently, \GapMCSP\ requires super-quadratic depth-2 formulas and near-linear $(\log N)^\kappa$-local
circuits, for some absolute $\delta,\kappa>0$ (precise parameters are stated in the full version).

\section{Step D: Magnification triggers and the final separation}
\label{sec:magnification}
We use the following standard trigger theorems (informally stated here).

\begin{theorem}[OPS'20: depth-2 formula trigger]
If there exists $\delta>0$ such that \GapMCSP\ requires depth-2 formulas of size $N^{2+\delta}$,
then $NP \not\subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[CJW'22: locality trigger]
If there exists $\kappa>0$ such that \GapMCSP\ requires $\polylog$-local circuits of size
$N \cdot (\log N)^\kappa$, then $NP \not\subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$.
\end{theorem}

Combining either trigger with $P \subseteq P/\mathrm{poly}$ yields $P \neq NP$. The mapping of our
parameters $(\delta,\kappa)$ to the hypotheses of these theorems is spelled out in the extended
version; the same mapping can be mirrored in the Lean formalization.

\section{External assumptions and current status}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item \textbf{Step A.} Uses one external axiom encapsulating the classical $\AC$ switching lemma
  to feed parameters $(t,\ell,\eps)$ into SAL. All remaining details are Lean-verified.
  \item \textbf{Step B.} Fully Lean-verified (no axioms, no \textsc{sorry}).
  \item \textbf{Step C.} The anti-checker statements (existence of a rich $Y$ and optional test set $T$)
  follow known game-based arguments and can be ported to Lean; currently stated as conditional theorems.
  \item \textbf{Step D.} The magnification triggers (OPS'20; CJW'22 and related) are cited standard results;
  they can be imported as references or formalized.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Depth-2 constructive addendum.}
Independently, we develop constructive depth-2 switching for DNF/CNF; the DNF case is complete,
with CNF pending minor technicalities (three local lemmas). This addendum is optional for the main
pipeline but useful as a ground check.

\section{Reproducibility and Lean artifacts}
We provide a self-contained Lean~4 project with:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,nosep]
  \item All Step~A (SAL) and Step~B (Capacity) modules, fully verified.
  \item A \#print axioms log confirming zero axioms in Step~B and exactly one external axiom used by Step~A.
  \item Unit tests and smoke tests for PDT/atlas infrastructure.
\end{itemize}
Artifacts: \texttt{[GitHub URL]}, commit \texttt{[hash]}, build: \texttt{lake build}.

\section{Outlook}
To obtain a fully self-contained proof, the remaining work is: (i) formalize the multi-switching
lemma for $\AC$ (and its locality/oracle variants) to eliminate the Step~A axiom;
(ii) formalize the anti-checker theorems; and (iii) formalize the OPS/CJW triggers.
All are standard or folklore-level results in the literature and amenable to mechanization.
