# PNP3: Publication-facing status snapshot

Updated: 2026-02-27

Canonical checklist for unconditional claim readiness:
`CHECKLIST_UNCONDITIONAL_P_NE_NP.md`.

## Current claim level

1. Active formalization is axiom-clean in `pnp3/`.
2. Final route compiles in `pnp3/Magnification/FinalResult.lean`.
3. Final `P ≠ NP` wrappers are conditional on explicit assumptions.

## Public statement rule

Until the checklist is fully closed, do not claim unconditional `P ≠ NP`.
