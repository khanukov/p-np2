# Technical Claims and Scope

Updated: 2026-02-27

Canonical unconditional-checklist:
`CHECKLIST_UNCONDITIONAL_P_NE_NP.md`.

## Verified claim level

1. Active `pnp3/` tree is axiom-clean (`axiom = 0`, `sorry/admit = 0`).
2. Final theorem surface compiles in `pnp3/Magnification/FinalResult.lean`.
3. Active final wrappers for `P ≠ NP` remain conditional on explicit hypotheses.

## Not currently claimed

1. No unconditional in-repo theorem `P ≠ NP`.
2. No claim that formula-separation endpoint alone closes full non-uniform
   separation without the explicit bridge assumption.

## Rule for public wording

Any statement of `P ≠ NP` must mention conditional assumptions until the
checklist in `CHECKLIST_UNCONDITIONAL_P_NE_NP.md` is fully closed.
