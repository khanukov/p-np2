## Switching-Atlas + Covering-Power: Lean-verified core and a conditional end-to-end pipeline

### What is new (our contribution)

We introduce and Lean-verify a constructive bridge from shrinkage to a uniform atlas of subcubes for whole families of Boolean functions (Switching-Atlas Lemma, SAL) and prove a general Covering-Power capacity bound for atlas-approximable families. Together, these results provide a reusable capacity barrier for lower-bounds pipelines based on switching methods.

**To the best of our knowledge**, this SAL packaging (common PDT with error → common atlas with leaf/ε budgets → capacity) is new in the literature, and our development offers the first Lean-checked implementation of this combinatorial spine.

### How this closes the loop (conditionally)

Plugging SAL + Covering-Power into standard anti-checker and magnification frameworks (e.g., OPS'21, Chen-Williams-Jin) produces a Lean-verified **conditional derivation** of NP ⊈ P/poly and hence P ≠ NP, assuming external results are available as axioms:

- Multi-switching lemmas for AC⁰ circuits
- Existence of large anti-checker families Y and small test sets
- Magnification triggers (locality lifts, succinct problem hardness)

The entire glue and all internal combinatorics are machine-checked; only explicitly marked axioms remain. See the OPS'21 ToC paper and magnification surveys for the surrounding framework.

### Priority statement

We are not aware of prior works that:

1. Formulate SAL as a general lemma producing a single atlas for an entire family from a single shrinkage certificate with verified invariants, and
2. Combine it with a formal capacity theorem to yield a plug-and-play barrier inside a Lean-verified A→B→C→D pipeline.

**Classical background**: Håstad-type switching, decision-tree depth shrinkage, and subcube reasoning are well-known; our contribution is the **packaging, formalization, and end-to-end integration** in Lean 4.

## Status and roadmap

### Unconditional (Lean-proved) results

- **SAL (shrinkage → unified atlas)**: Constructive transformation with verified invariants
- **Covering-Power (capacity barrier)**: General upper bound for atlas-approximable families
- **Infrastructure**: Complete PDT/Atlas/Scenario data structures with invariants
- **All glue code**: Machine-checked connections between components

### Conditional final result

From external facts (multi-switching for AC⁰; anti-checker for MCSP-like problems; magnification triggers), the derivation NP ⊈ P/poly ⇒ P ≠ NP follows. All "stitching" is formally verified.

### Novelty

First Lean-verified composition of shrinkage → atlas → capacity using a unified atlas for the entire family. This makes anti-checker constructions a "standard module" (it suffices to exhibit |Y| > capacity).

### Roadmap to unconditional result

To achieve an unconditional separation:

1. **Formalize multi-switching** and anti-checker constructions (OPS/MCSP branch)
2. **Formalize magnification triggers** (Chen/OPS/CJW branch)
3. **Replace all axioms** with constructive proofs

See ITCS'20 magnification survey and related work for theoretical background.

## Compliance note

### Clay Mathematics Institute rules

We emphasize that the present Lean development delivers a **conditional end-to-end derivation** of P ≠ NP. Under the Clay Mathematics Institute rules, consideration of the Millennium Prize requires:

1. A complete, **unconditional** solution
2. Publication in a qualifying refereed journal
3. Survival of at least two years after publication
4. General acceptance in the global mathematics community

A formal proof in Lean is a strength for reliability and reproducibility but is **not a substitute** for these requirements. Our work focuses on the scientific contribution to complexity theory and formal verification, not on prize consideration.

### Our positioning

We build on classical results in circuit complexity and provide:

- **Full Lean 4 verification** of the entire pipeline

- **Formal methods**: Demonstrating feasibility of large-scale complexity theory formalization
- **Complexity theory**: Providing reusable, verified building blocks for lower-bound research
