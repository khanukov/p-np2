# TODO (Active)

This file is intentionally short. The full plan lives in `docs/Roadmap.md`.

## Top priorities
1. Remove `localizedFamilyWitness_partial` from final theorem cone.
2. Internalize witness-production path (`FamilyIsAC0` / `FamilyIsLocalCircuit`) where feasible.
3. Keep audit automation and proof-status docs in sync with code.

## Done recently
- Constructive anti-checker large-`Y` certificate flow in partial cone.
- Anti-checker cone axiom audit and `False.elim` regression guard.
- Documentation consolidation under `docs/`.
