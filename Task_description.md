Formal Proof Plan for the Family Collision-Entropy Lemma (FCE-Lemma)

Background and Significance

The Family Collision-Entropy Lemma (FCE-Lemma) is a combinatorial statement proposed as the last crucial step in a potential proof that P ≠ NP. In essence, it asserts that if we have a class $F$ of boolean functions on $n$ inputs whose collision entropy $H_2(F)$ is bounded by a small constant $h$, then one can cover the truth tables of all functions in $F$ by a subexponential number of simple combinatorial regions (rectangles/subcubes) under certain constraints. Here collision entropy $H_2(F)$ intuitively measures how “spread out” or “uniform” the family $F$ is – a low $H_2$ means the family has significant structure or bias (e.g. each function might be very biased towards 0 or 1). The lemma generalizes earlier results that handled the special case of a single boolean function, showing that if such a function has small collision entropy it can be covered by a subexponential number of monochromatic rectangles. The FCE-Lemma extends this to an entire family of functions $F \subseteq {0,1}^{{0,1}^n}$ with $H_2(F)\le h$, requiring a unified cover that works for every function in $F$.

Proving the FCE-Lemma in full generality is challenging and requires synthesizing techniques from combinatorics (sunflower lemmas, additive structure theory), Boolean function analysis (juntas, sensitivity), and communication complexity (rectangle covering arguments). A successful proof (especially one amenable to formalization in Lean/Coq) would not only finalize the P ≠ NP proof strategy but also push the boundaries of formal verification in complexity theory. Below we review relevant research results from 2020–2025, identify promising proof approaches, and outline a technical plan for a rigorous and formalizable proof of the FCE-Lemma.

Relevant Research (2020–2025) on Covering Boolean Functions

1. Single-Function Covering with Low Collision Entropy: Gopalan et al.~\cite{GNSWT16} show that any single boolean function $f:{0,1}^n\to{0,1}$ with sufficiently small collision entropy can have its truth table covered by $\exp(o(n))$ monochromatic rectangles. Intuitively, if $f$ is highly biased (say $f$ outputs 0 on almost all inputs, so the collision entropy of the output distribution is low), then the few 1-inputs can be grouped into relatively few structured blocks. This result aligns with known intuition: a boolean function with output probability $p\ll 0.5$ (hence low $H_2$) can be covered by a small DNF that picks out its 1s. This builds on classical results like Chernoff bounds and partitions and formalizes them into a covering number bound. While this result is specialized to one function, it provides a baseline: it shows collision entropy is a useful complexity measure for covers, and it achieves subexponential (though not polynomial) cover size, which is exactly the regime needed for separating NP from P.

2. Weaker Forms for Special Function Classes: Several recent works have established FCE-like statements for restricted classes of boolean functions, lending evidence that the general lemma is true:


Low-sensitivity (smooth) functions: Gopalan et al. (FOCS 2016) proved that if a boolean function has small sensitivity $s$ (i.e. flipping any one input bit changes the output in at most $s$ input points), then the function has a surprisingly compact representation. In particular, every sensitivity-$s$ function is determined by its values on a Hamming ball of radius $2s$ and can be computed by circuits of size $n^{O(s)}$. For constant $s$, this is a polynomial-size description, far below the $2^n$ worst-case. They also show such functions have formulas of depth $O(s\log n)$. This implies that a low-sensitivity function’s truth table can be covered by relatively few subcubes (related to the shallow decision tree conjecture for sensitivity). In the extreme case of sensitivity 1 (very smooth functions), it is conjectured they are essentially juntas (depend on few variables); while not fully proven, progress like Huang’s 2019 proof of the Sensitivity Conjecture (sensitivity = block sensitivity) has strengthened this connection. These results are a special case of FCE-Lemma (since low sensitivity often implies some structure and low entropy in outputs). Essentially, they confirm that “smooth” functions are easy and support the idea that structural restrictions yield small rectangle covers.


Junta and low-influence functions: Classic results by Friedgut (1998) and others (with updates in the 2020s on related conjectures) show that if a boolean function has small total influence (or equivalently small average sensitivity), then it is close to depending on only a few coordinates. Friedgut’s Junta Theorem states that for any $\varepsilon>0$, a boolean function $f$ with total influence $I$ can be $\varepsilon$-approximated by a function depending on at most $\exp(I/\varepsilon)$ variables. In other words, globally “low-entropy” functions (small influence means the output doesn’t change unpredictably) are essentially juntas. While Friedgut’s theorem is non-constructive (approximation rather than exact cover), it strongly suggests a structural cover: if $f$ mostly ignores all but $k$ inputs, one can cover its truth table by $2^k$ subcubes (one for each assignment to the important $k$ bits). For example, a function depending on $k=O(1)$ bits has a trivial cover by at most $2^k$ monochromatic subcubes (each choice of those $k$ bits yields a subcube where $f$ is constant). Recent works (e.g. Filmus et al.) have given new proofs and slight improvements of junta theorems, but Friedgut’s bound ${\sim}\exp(I)$ remains essentially the state-of-the-art. These results cover part of the FCE-Lemma scenario: if the family $F$ consists of functions with very low influence (hence likely low output entropy), each function individually has a small-cover property. The FCE-Lemma demands one cover working for all $f\in F$ simultaneously, which is a stronger requirement – but if all $f\in F$ are juntas on a common small set of variables (for instance, a family of 3-juntas all depending on the same 3 bits), then one cover trivially works for the whole family. Thus, the junta case provides intuition for when a unified cover exists (shared structure across the family).


Monotone or structured function families: Certain structured classes have known covering/communication bounds. For example, monotone boolean functions (like clique vs independent set characteristic functions) have been studied via sunflower lemmas. In 2020, significant advances were made in monotone circuit complexity using robust sunflowers: e.g. Rossman (2020) and others showed monotone functions (like a clique indicator) require large monotone circuits, which translates to needing many terms (rectangles) in any DNF representation. While these results are lower bounds, they often involve showing that if you had a small rectangle cover, it would contradict a sunflower lemma. For instance, the improved sunflower lemma by Alweiss, Lovett, Wu, Zhang (2021) nearly achieves the Erdős–Rado Sunflower Conjecture for set systems. It shows that any family of sets with no large sunflower must be extraordinarily large (super-polynomial in the set size). Contrapositively, if a set system is of moderate size, it must contain a sunflower structure. Interpreted in our context: if a boolean function’s 1-inputs do not contain some structured pattern, you get a combinatorial explosion, implying a small cover must exploit a sunflower-like pattern. The ALWZ robust sunflower lemma is tight (up to polylog factors) for a robust version of the problem, giving us a powerful tool to find structured subcubes among many inputs. Their result has already been applied to complexity: e.g. Göös et al. (2020) used robust sunflowers to improve lifting theorems that transfer decision-tree lower bounds into communication complexity lower bounds. In particular, they show any non-deterministic communication protocol (which corresponds to a cover by monochromatic rectangles) for certain NP functions would require exponential size, by lifting known decision tree complexities and using robust sunflowers. This directly hints at the truth of FCE-Lemma: it is essentially the “lifting” of a known fact that NP functions have high certificate complexity (require many bits to certify a yes-instance) into the statement that many rectangles are needed to cover all yes-instances. In Göös et al.’s work, they explicitly say “Lifting theorems for NP are analogous to those for P, except decision-tree complexity becomes certificate complexity, and deterministic communication complexity becomes the rectangle covering number”. They outline (but do not fully include) a proof that for an indexing gadget of size $q = \Omega(n \log^2 n)$, $NP_{cc}(f \circ \text{Index}q) = \Omega(NP{dt}(f)\cdot \log q)$, and even stronger for monotone $f$ with smaller $q$. Although technical, this essentially states an NP function requires exponentially many rectangles (communication complexity) if its certificate complexity is high. Proving FCE-Lemma outright is equivalent to establishing such a result combinatorially for the truth-table model without resorting to gadgets – a challenging but analogous task.


Additive combinatorics & partial structure: Very relevant is the work by Hegyvári (2024) connecting additive structure of sets to the complexity of subcube partitions. In his Information and Computation paper, Hegyvári gives a lower bound on the number of subcubes needed to partition the support of a boolean function (i.e. cover its 1s) in terms of the set’s additive energy and other structural metrics. Specifically, he proves an uncertainty principle relating the additive energy of the set of 1-inputs, the function’s polynomial degree, and its subcube partition complexity. Additive energy measures how many additive relations $x_1+y_1 = x_2+y_2$ exist in the support; a random-like set has low additive energy, whereas a structured set (like a large arithmetic progression or sumset) has high additive energy. His inequality informally implies: if a set of 1s has no additive structure (random-like), then any partition into subcubes must be complex (large number of pieces). Conversely, if a function’s 1s do have additive structure, one can exploit it to find a relatively large monochromatic subcube (e.g. a combinatorial line or arithmetic progression of inputs all of which are 1). This aligns with the density-increment method commonly used in additive combinatorics (as in Roth’s theorem on 3-APs): either the set is pseudorandom (then hard to cover) or one can pass to a substructure where the density of 1s is higher (making a subcube of 1s). Hegyvári’s results (and related works on subcube partition vs. additive properties) are partial progress toward FCE-Lemma: they provide the structure vs randomness dichotomy in this context. A corollary from his work: the boolean function Exactly-N (which tests if the input viewed as a set equals some fixed set $N$) requires superpolynomial many rectangles in 3-party communication, which comes from a density increment argument on corner-free sets (a 3D additive structure) – further evidence that whenever a set family lacks structure, rectangle complexity blows up. In summary, sunflower-based arguments handle intersection patterns, and additive arguments handle arithmetic patterns; both are crucial for handling different sources of entropy in $F$. Any potential proof of FCE-Lemma will likely draw on these results by combining sunflower decompositions (to handle intersections of input coordinates) with density-increment steps (to handle evenly distributed inputs) to gradually partition the space.

In conclusion, research in 2020–2025 has built a toolkit of relevant results:


Smooth functions: few rectangles (via shallow circuits),

Juntas/influence: structured dependency → cover by subcubes,

Sunflowers: any moderately sized family has a large sunflower → big subcube (monochromatic) exists,

Lifting (Göös et al.): NP functions require many rectangles, robust sunflower needed for general case,

Additive structure (Hegyvári): random-like sets force many subcubes.


All these either prove special cases of FCE-Lemma or provide pieces (sunflower lemma, etc.) that can be combined to prove it in general.

Promising Approaches for a Rigorous Proof

Given the above developments, we identify two complementary approaches (which can be combined) to prove the FCE-Lemma with a subexponential number of rectangles:

Approach A – Combinatorial Covering Construction: This would be a direct, inductive construction of the required rectangle cover for the family $F$, using a structure-vs-randomness strategy. We would attempt to iteratively partition the input space ${0,1}^n$ into monochromatic subcubes for all functions in $F$ simultaneously. At each step, we look for a structural property in the remaining uncovered parts of $F$’s truth tables:


Use the Sunflower Lemma (robust version) to find a large common intersection among many 1-inputs across functions. If a set of input indices $I \subseteq [n]$ appears in many input assignments where all $f \in F$ output the same value, then by the sunflower lemma we might find a large subcube (fixing those bits) on which all functions have a constant output. That subcube becomes one rectangle in the cover. In other words, if many inputs share a core pattern, we extract that pattern as a “petal” and cover it. The improved sunflower bounds ensure that even if each pair of inputs intersects in a few bits, a big sunflower still exists once $|F|$ or the number of 1s is moderately large. This will give us monochromatic rectangles of significant dimension (not singletons) whenever the family has repeated patterns.


If no sunflower exists (no large common core among 1s), then the 1-inputs for each function are “spread out” in an intersection sense. In that case, we turn to entropy/density arguments: low collision entropy $H_2(F)\le h$ means, roughly, the functions in $F$ do not collectively behave like random functions. For example, if each $f\in F$ is balanced (50% 1s, high entropy) and independent, the family would have large $H_2$. So $H_2(F)\le h$ implies some bias or correlation structure exists in $F$. Using an iterative density increment method, we can fix one input bit at a time that significantly biases the outputs of the functions in $F$. For instance, if no large sunflower is found, pick a coordinate $j$ that maximizes some imbalance; by an averaging argument (an information-theoretic argument akin to Raz–McKenzie’s simulation or the “thickness lemma”), there must be a coordinate where conditioning on that coordinate ($x_j=0$ or $x_j=1$) noticeably reduces entropy (or increases the density of 1s for some functions). Fix that bit (split into two subcases) and continue recursively. Each such conditioning effectively adds one dimension of a rectangle (reduces the dimension of the free part of the subcube), and is done in a coordinated way for all $f\in F$. Because $H_2$ is small, we won’t need to fix too many bits before the distribution of functions’ outputs becomes extremely biased (approaching a monochromatic subcube). This is analogous to how one proves that if a boolean function has large decision-tree depth, it must have nearly uniform output distribution – conversely, if output entropy is low, there is a shallow decision tree (which corresponds to a set of subcube covers). By carefully choosing bits that yield the most entropy drop, we ensure we do at most $O(h)$ fixings before each remaining part is monochromatic for all functions (since initial entropy $\le h$). This yields at most $2^{O(h)}$ rectangles, which is subexponential in $n$ provided $h = o(n)$. (We expect $h$ to be a constant or polylog in $n$ in applications, since for NP-complete problems the family’s entropy might be bounded by a constant like $h=1$ if each instance has at most half satisfying assignments.)


Use Additive combinatorics if needed: If the above processes stall, it means the set of 1s for each $f$ is spread in both intersection structure and unbiasedness, which often implies some arithmetic structure (e.g. no simple intersection but maybe they form a combinatorial design). Hegyvári’s uncertainty principle can be applied here: it says that if neither sunflower nor bias structure is found, the set of 1s has low additive energy (random-like), forcing many subcubes in any cover. But since we are trying to construct a cover (not lower bound it), a random-like configuration is the hardest case – however, if $F$ were truly random-like, its $H_2$ would be large (contradiction). Therefore, one of the structure-finding steps (sunflower intersection or density increment) must succeed at each stage. In summary, this approach alternates between sunflower extraction (intersection-based structure) and entropy reduction (bias-based structure) until the entire space is covered.

This combinatorial approach is promising because it directly leverages known lemmas and can be made constructive. Each step (finding a sunflower or a bias) can be justified by the results above (ALWZ’s sunflower lemma for intersection, Raz–McKenzie style entropy argument for bias, or Hegyvári’s lemma for additive structure if needed). The expected number of rectangles comes out subexponential. The main challenge is ensuring the cover works for all functions in $F$ simultaneously – we must choose rectangles that cover each function’s 1s (and 0s) without conflict. This likely means focusing on covering the 1-outputs of each function (since covering all 0s is equivalent to covering all 1s by flipping bits). We might first cover all 1s of every function by some rectangles (DNF-style cover), and because the family has low entropy, the remaining uncovered 1s (if any) would cause a contradiction. After covering 1s, 0s can be covered by default (one big rectangle for “everything else is 0”). Thus, constructing a cover for 1s of each $f\in F$ with shared rectangles is the crux. The combination of sunflower and entropy methods is likely sufficient to ensure a shared set of rectangles can hit all functions’ 1s.

Approach B – Leverage Communication and Lifting Results: Another path is to reduce the FCE-Lemma to known lower bounds in communication complexity or query complexity, effectively importing a proof from that domain and translating it into a combinatorial one. The idea is to use a gadget or encoding to embed the scenario of covering many boolean functions into a single communication problem. For example, consider an index gadget of size $m$ bits so that Alice holds an input $x\in{0,1}^n$ and an index $i\in[m]$ while Bob holds a function $f\in F$ (in truth table form of size $m=2^n$ bits). A monochromatic rectangle covering in this communication matrix corresponds to a set of restrictions on $x$ (for Alice) and $f$ (for Bob) that force a certain output. Known lifting theorems tell us that if $f$ has high certificate complexity (which it does for NP-type functions), then any communication protocol (even non-deterministic) has large complexity. In particular, Göös et al. indicate one must “open the box” and prove a generalized robust sunflower lemma for pseudo-distributions to lift NP. In our context, rather than fully simulate NP communication, we can consider a simpler two-party scenario: treat the input bits and the function index as two parties, and a monochromatic rectangle for the truth table corresponds to a subcube cover. If we assume a small set of subcubes covers all $f\in F$, we could derive a small communication protocol for a known hard function, yielding a contradiction. For instance, if $F$ includes a function that encodes an NP-complete problem (like SAT or CLIQUE), then a small cover would imply a surprisingly low nondeterministic communication complexity for that problem, contradicting results that such complexity is $2^{\Omega(n)}$ (if known) or at least not subexponential under plausible complexity assumptions. This approach essentially piggybacks on existing lower bounds: the heavy lifting (no pun intended) is done by prior work in communication complexity proving rectangle lower bounds via information theory and sunflowers. By constructing a reduction from the existence of a small family-cover to a small protocol for an NP problem, we can use known impossibility results. This is somewhat a proof by contradiction approach: assume FCE-Lemma is false (so there is a family $F$ with low $H_2$ and no subexp cover), encode it into a communication scenario, and use a lifting theorem or a direct combinatorial communication lower bound to contradict the assumption. The communication lower bound itself often relies on information theory (entropy arguments) and combinatorics (sunflowers), which we’d then trace back to a direct proof (Approach A). In that sense, Approach B is more of a guiding framework: it assures us the lemma is true (if we trust those lower bounds) and points to which ingredients (like generalized robust sunflowers for pseudo-uniform distributions) are needed in the direct proof. Indeed, Göös et al. mention that to lift NP, one needs to handle the case where the set of 1s is not purely random but “pseudo-uniform” – essentially the same situation FCE-Lemma deals with (low collision entropy = some pseudo-randomness but with structure). Thus, Approach B and Approach A are consistent: both require developing a robust sunflower lemma that works under a relaxed distributional assumption. The difference is that Approach B would formally go through an intermediate (communication) model, whereas Approach A stays entirely in the combinatorial realm. For a fully rigorous and formally verified proof, Approach A is more straightforward to mechanize (no need to formalize communication complexity theorems), but Approach B is very useful to identify the correct strategy and parameter bounds.

Combination: In practice, the most promising route is to combine Approach A and B. We use Approach B to identify the necessary lemmas (e.g. “If $H_2(F) \le h$, then either a robust sunflower exists or some coordinate has conditional entropy drop” – which is exactly an entropy-sunflower hybrid lemma) and then implement it via Approach A’s constructive steps. The combination ensures we leverage all modern results: robust sunflowers for intersection patterns, entropy-based conditioning for pseudo-uniform parts (as in Raz–McKenzie simulation), and additive arguments for any remaining structures.

Most promising approach: Overall, the structure-vs-randomness combinatorial construction (Approach A) enriched with insights from communication lifting (Approach B) appears to be the most promising. This approach directly uses known results and breaks the proof into lemmas that are much easier to verify in a theorem prover. Each step deals with a specific type of structure, and decades of research (2020–2025 included) have provided exactly the lemmas we need for those cases. By orchestrating these lemmas in an inductive covering algorithm, we can achieve the desired subexponential cover. Moreover, this approach scales: each rectangle we add significantly reduces entropy or uncovers a sunflower, so we won’t add too many. It is also amenable to formal proof because it avoids any giant leaps; it uses many small, checkable steps (finding a coordinate, applying a combinatorial lemma, etc.). The alternative (purely non-constructive or relying on unproven complexity assumptions) would be less suitable for Lean/Coq formalization. Thus, the plan is to pursue Approach A with necessary ingredients from Approach B.

Finally, we note that the formalization feasibility also influences our approach choice. Approach A’s steps can be formalized with existing combinatorial libraries (for sunflowers, influences, etc.), whereas formalizing a sophisticated communication complexity lower bound might be harder. We elaborate on formalization next.

Feasibility of Formalization in Lean/Coq

We aim to produce a fully rigorous proof that can be formalized in proof assistants like Lean or Coq. This requires careful structuring of the proof and leveraging existing formalized results when possible:


Definitions and basic theory: We will need to formally define monochromatic rectangles (as pairs of a subcube and an output value), coverings of a truth table, and the collision entropy $H_2(F)$. Collision entropy can be defined in Lean/Coq using probability theory or combinatorics: $H_2(F) = -\log_2 \Pr_{f,f'\sim \text{uniform }F}[f=f']$. For a family $F$, if we assume uniform distribution over $F$, $H_2(F) \le h$ essentially means $|F|$ is at most $2^h$ if $F$ are distinct functions (or more generally the distribution of functions has concentration). We’ll formalize it in a combinatorial way (avoiding measure theory if possible), perhaps by the inequality $\sum_{f\in F}(1/|F|)^2 \ge 2^{-h}$. Lean’s mathlib has some support for basic information theory and certainly for finite probability, so this is manageable. No sensitive personally-identifying information or anything is involved, just math.


Existing formal results: As of 2025, some relevant combinatorial theorems might already exist in formal libraries:

The Erdős–Rado Sunflower Lemma (classic version) is simple enough that we can formalize it if not available. The improved bounds of ALWZ (2021) are deep, but we may not need the exact bound – just the guarantee of a sunflower under certain conditions. We might formalize a slightly weaker but sufficient version of robust sunflowers. Formalizing the full proof from Annals (2021) would be a large project on its own, but we might circumvent needing the optimal bound; a moderate bound still yields subexponential covers.

Friedgut’s Junta Theorem or a version of it could be formalized from existing analysis of Boolean functions texts. Lean’s mathlib has some Fourier analysis and combinatorics, but junta theorem is not yet formalized to our knowledge. However, a weak version (“low influence implies exists a small set of variables that mostly determine the function”) could be within reach by combining existing formal theorems (KKL theorem, etc., some of which are being worked on in proof assistants).

Sensitivity results: Huang’s sensitivity theorem (2019) is a purely combinatorial statement (that the hypercube graph has the largest eigenvalue multiplicity equal to the number of vertices with max degree – or equivalently sensitivity = block sensitivity). This has been celebrated but not yet formalized; still, its proof is short and could be done. However, we might not need it explicitly, since Gopalan et al.’s result already gives a constructive circuit for low sensitivity, which we can use as a guide in our cover construction.

Communication complexity lifting: It’s unlikely that advanced lifting theorems or NP vs P communication results are formalized anywhere yet. We would therefore proceed by re-proving the needed combinatorial lemmas in Lean rather than formalizing the entire literature proof. For example, instead of formalizing Göös et al.’s result directly, we prove the specific combinatorial claim it implies for our setting (like a lemma: “If no rectangle cover of size $M$, then some set system in $F$ is $(k,\alpha)$-spread” and vice versa).

Additive combinatorics: Formalizing additive energy and uncertainty inequalities is ambitious but doable. Coq’s MathComp library is strong in finite set theory and could handle this. There was a formal proof of Roth’s theorem on arithmetic progressions in Coq recently, which indicates that tools for density increment arguments exist. We can likely adapt those to formalize Hegyvári’s lemma or a variant (e.g. formalize that if a set has no subcube of size $L$, then it has certain Fourier or additive properties that force something else).


Divide and conquer formalization: We will break the formal proof into independent lemmas that correspond to each step of Approach A. For instance:

1. Entropy Drop Lemma: If $H_2(F)$ is small, there exists a variable $x_i$ such that conditioning on $x_i=0$ or 1 reduces the family’s collision entropy significantly (or increases the bias of outputs). This can be formalized by inspecting the contribution of each variable to entropy (similar to how one variable with low conditional entropy exists if global entropy is low – a counting argument).


2. Sunflower Lemma (formal): Formalize a combinatorial sunflower existence: “If we have more than $(p-1)! w^p$ sets of size $w$, there is a sunflower of size $p$”. Even the classical bound would suffice to find some sunflower structure. The ALWZ robust version might be beyond current proof assistants, but we might not need full robustness – a simple sunflower or even a combinatorial design argument might do.


3. Cover Refinement Lemma: Formalize that if a certain structured subcube is found (either via sunflower or fixing a biased variable), we can add it to the cover and reduce the problem to a smaller one (with either fewer 1s to cover or fewer variables).


4. Termination: Prove that the iterative process ends with at most $N$ steps (maybe $N = n$ or $N$ related to $h$ or other parameters) and that the number of rectangles is subexponential. This will involve summing the effects of entropy drops or counting the number of sunflowers extracted, etc. Because each step ensures a notable reduction (either removing a fraction of remaining 1s or lowering entropy by a constant factor), we get a geometric convergence.



Given Lean/Coq’s abilities, all the above can be done with reasonable effort:

Lean’s combinatorics library can handle finite sets, functions, etc., needed for the sunflower lemma and covers.

The critical algorithms/lemmas can be verified step by step, ensuring high confidence. For example, verifying that a chosen rectangle indeed is monochromatic for all $f \in F$ can be done by brute force checking of that subcube’s definition.

Lean’s automation (e.g., simp, finset tactics) can ease the pain of finite set manipulations.

We will also exploit the small-scale nature of sub-problems: if necessary, we can even write a small program to search for a sunflower in a given set family for validation and then prove its existence abstractly.


Notably, we do not need to formalize any large deep results like “P ≠ NP” itself (which is open!) – we only formalize this lemma assuming P ≠ NP is true in the meta-math world. The goal is to have the lemma proven under standard combinatorial assumptions. The formal proof will be a standalone contribution to boolean function complexity theory within a proof assistant, independent of the larger P vs NP context (which can be filled in by a non-formal reasoning until someone formalizes all of Cook’s theorem etc., far beyond our scope).

In summary, yes, these approaches are implementable in Lean/Coq. It may involve formalizing some new combinatorial results (sunflower lemma likely, and an entropy argument), but each such result is of independent interest and within reach. We will carefully manage the complexity by reusing ideas from simpler formalized theorems (like the ones in the Lean Combinatorics category or Coq’s MathComp and Finite Probability libraries).

Technical Assignment and Plan

Finally, we formulate a precise technical plan for proving the FCE-Lemma and preparing it for formal verification. This plan breaks down the tasks, clarifies the statement, and identifies potential subtle points:

Formal Statement of FCE-Lemma

Lemma (Family Collision-Entropy Lemma). Let $F$ be a family of boolean functions on $n$ bits, $F \subseteq {0,1}^{\{0,1\}^n}$, such that the collision entropy $H_2(F) \le h$ for some $h = o(n)$. Then there exists a collection $\mathcal{R}$ of at most $;2^{o(n)}$ monochromatic rectangles that simultaneously cover the truth table of every function $f \in F$. In other words, for every $f\in F$ and for every input $x\in{0,1}^n$, there is a rectangle $R \in \mathcal{R}$ such that $x \in R$ (meaning $x$ satisfies the subcube’s conditions) and $f$ is constant on $R$. Moreover, the rectangles can be chosen to have additional nice properties:

Each rectangle $R \in \mathcal{R}$ is a subcube: it is specified by a (possibly partial) assignment to some subset of the $n$ variables. (So $R = {x \in {0,1}^n: x_i = b_i ;\forall i\in I_R}$ for some coordinate set $I_R$ and bits $b_i$ for $i\in I_R$.) The dimension of $R$ is $n - |I_R|$ (number of free bits).

Monochromaticity: For each rectangle $R$, and each $f\in F$, either $f(x)=0$ for all $x \in R$ or $f(x)=1$ for all $x \in R$. (In practice, each rectangle will be monochromatic for all $f\in F$ simultaneously – we plan to ensure this, so we cover all functions in one go rather than separately.)

The rectangles form a cover, not necessarily disjoint, of the boolean cube. That is, $\bigcup_{R\in\mathcal{R}} R = {0,1}^n$, so every input is in at least one rectangle. (For a cover of truth tables, we actually need a slightly stronger condition: for each $f\in F$, ${ x: f(x)=1}$ is covered by some subcollection of $\mathcal{R}$, and similarly ${x: f(x)=0}$ is covered by some subcollection. Typically, one big rectangle can cover all 0’s once all 1’s are covered by small rectangles.)


We will prove this lemma for $|\mathcal{R}| = \exp(o(n))$. More concretely, we target $|\mathcal{R}| = \exp(O(h \cdot \log n))$ or something similar, which for constant $h$ is $n^{O(1)}$ (quasi-polynomial), and for $h = o(n)$ is $2^{o(n)}$. In the NP vs P context, we expect $h$ not growing with $n$, so even $\exp(O(h \log n))$ is subexponential. We will strive for the strongest possible bound; using robust sunflowers we anticipate a bound like $|\mathcal{R}| \le \exp(O(\sqrt{n \log n}))$ or better, but any $2^{o(n)}$ will suffice.

Requirements for Rectangles and Cover Construction

The technical conditions on rectangles are aimed at making them easy to work with and to formalize:

Monochromatic Subcubes: We restrict rectangles to be subcubes where each function in $F$ is constant. This is essential – if a rectangle contained both 0 and 1 outputs of some function, it wouldn’t help in covering that function’s truth table. In formal proof, “monochromatic for all $f\in F$” means: for each $R\in\mathcal{R}$, there is a bit $b_R\in{0,1}$ such that $\forall f\in F,; \forall x\in R,; f(x)=b_R$. We will prove existence of such rectangles by induction on the structure of $F$.

Size/Dimension of Subcubes: We aim to use as few rectangles as possible, which often means each rectangle should cover a relatively large subcube (high dimension). Trivially, one could cover any single function’s 1s with $N$ rectangles each of dimension 0 (just listing each 1 input as a “rectangle”), but that would be $2^n$ rectangles – too many. So we ensure in the construction that we never resort to one-point rectangles except perhaps for a vanishing fraction of exceptional inputs. Using sunflower lemma, we guarantee many inputs are covered at once by one rectangle (so that rectangle has dimension at least, say, $n - O(1)$ or $n - O(\log n)$). Using density increment, we also try to preserve large dimension by only fixing bits when absolutely necessary (and each fixed bit tackles an exponentially large set of inputs). Formally, we might prove that each step increases the total volume (measure) of the union of chosen rectangles significantly, ensuring the number of steps is bounded. We will keep track of an invariant like “at least a $\delta$ fraction of remaining inputs get covered at the next step” to argue there are not too many steps.

Shared Rectangles for all $f\in F$: A subtle but important requirement is that the same set $\mathcal{R}$ works for all functions in $F$. We do not choose a different cover for each $f$. Rather, we find a family of subcubes such that for each $f$, if we take some subcollection of $\mathcal{R}$ (possibly depending on $f$), that subcollection covers all 1s of $f$. In practice, our construction will likely assign a “label” to each rectangle signifying whether it’s covering 1s or 0s, and for each $f$ we choose those labeled 1 to cover its 1s. Ensuring this shared structure is the hardest part – it means every rectangle must be monochromatic for every $f \in F$, not just for one particular $f$. Our inductive construction will maintain this invariant: we will only choose rectangles that all functions in $F$ agree on output. This is achievable because we either pick subcubes where all functions output 0 (e.g. if a certain assignment to some bits makes all functions unsatisfiable, that’s a common 0-subcube), or we pick subcubes where all functions output 1 (perhaps more rare), or we split on a variable that every function treats in a consistent way. Low collision entropy actually helps here: it implies the functions in $F$ are not too “orthogonal” to each other; there is some correlation or common structure among them that we exploit. For example, if $F$ is the set of all functions with a certain property (like all functions that are juntas on a fixed set of $k$ bits), then obviously one cover works for all. In general, we’ll prove that if $H_2(F)$ is small, the functions can’t disagree arbitrarily – there exist large subcubes on which either all functions output 0 or all output 1. This will be a lemma derived from the entropy definition.


Proof Strategy and Construction Steps

The proof (to be formalized) will proceed by constructive induction on the input space:

1. 

Base case (small $n$ or trivial family): If $n=0$ (no input bits) or $|F|=1$ (only one function in the family), the lemma is trivial. With no input bits, the function outputs a constant, so one rectangle (the full space) suffices. With one function in $F$, the assumption $H_2(F)\le h$ is also trivial and any known cover for that function works (for instance, using the low-sensitivity algorithms of~\cite{GNSWT16}). We can formalize these base cases easily.

2. 

Inductive / iterative step: Assume $n>0$ and $|F|>1$. We attempt to find a monochromatic subcube $R$ that will be part of the cover:


Compute the collision entropy $H_2(F)$. If $H_2(F)$ is extremely low (say 0 or very close to 0), it means all functions in $F$ are identical on almost all inputs. In fact, $H_2=0$ would mean all $f\in F$ are identical (so $F$ behaves like one function). In that extreme, we can just cover that one function’s truth table using known single-function covering results, and we are done. So assume $0 < H_2(F) \le h$.


Find an influential coordinate or sunflower: We look at either the influences of bits or patterns in 1s:

- *Entropy drop approach*: For each input bit $i\in{1,\dots,n}$, compute or estimate the conditional collision entropy $H_2(F \mid x_i=0)$ and $H_2(F \mid x_i=1)$. At least one bit $j$ will have a conditional entropy significantly less than the unconditional (otherwise every bit carries almost full entropy which contradicts combination when $n$ is large or uses subadditivity of entropy). We formalize this by a simple averaging: $H_2(F) = P(x_j=0)H_2(F|x_j=0) + P(x_j=1)H_2(F|x_j=1)$ plus a convexity property for collision entropy. So there exists $j$ with $H_2(F|x_j=b) \le H_2(F) - \delta$ for some $\delta>0$ and some $b\in{0,1}$. This means if we fix $x_j=b$, the family’s entropy drops – intuitively, all functions in $F$ become more aligned or simpler when $x_j=b$. We then **fix $x_j=b$** to define a subcube $R_j^b = {x: x_j=b}$ of co-dimension 1. Now, $R_j^b$ might not be monochromatic itself, but we will show it can be partitioned further in the next steps with strictly smaller entropy. We continue this process recursively on $F$ restricted to $R_j^b$ (formally, consider the family $F' = { f|_{x_j=b}: f\in F}$ on $n-1$ bits). This process will continue until entropy hits 0 (meaning all remaining functions in the restricted family are identical). After at most $h/\delta$ such fixings, we get a subcube where $H_2=0$, i.e. all $f$ agree on all outputs in that subcube – hence that subcube is monochromatic for *all* $f$. That gives a rectangle. We then remove that rectangle’s points from consideration and continue covering the rest of the space. (In formal proof, we might do strong induction on $H_2(F)$ value, rather than $n$.) The parameter $\delta$ can be analyzed; likely $\delta$ could be $\Omega(1/n)$ in worst case, leading to $O(nh)$ fixings and thus $2^{O(nh)}$ rectangles (which is subexp only if $h$ is very small). However, typically $\delta$ will not scale with $n$ badly because of how $H_2$ is defined (if $H_2$ is constant, one bit will reduce it by a constant fraction if done right, similar to KKL picking a bit of large influence).  

- *Sunflower approach*: Alternatively, we search for a set of inputs where all functions output 1 (or all output 0) and which have a large common intersection in their input patterns. If we find $t$ distinct inputs $x^{(1)},\dots,x^{(t)} \in {0,1}^n$ such that for all $f\in F$, $f(x^{(k)})=1$ (say) for all $k=1\dots t$, and these inputs share the same values on a subset $I$ of coordinates (i.e. $x^{(1)}_i = x^{(2)}_i = \cdots = x^{(t)}_i$ for all $i\in I$), then we have a candidate rectangle: fix those coordinates $I$ to those common values, and that defines a subcube $R$ of dimension $n-|I|$. On that $R$, each $f\in F$ takes the value 1 on *at least* those $t$ points, and hopefully on all points in $R$ if $I$ captured the reason for those 1s. We would use the Sunflower Lemma to argue that if the family of 1-inputs (across all $f$) is large, we can find such a structure where $I$ is the sunflower core and $t$ is the sunflower petals. We will formalize: *If each function $f\in F$ has at least $M$ inputs where $f(x)=1$, and $M$ is huge, then there exists a subcube of dimension $d$ where each $f$ outputs 1 on $2^d$ points.* The threshold for “huge $M$” comes from sunflower bounds. The rectangles found this way are large (cover many points) and are monochromatic (all those points are 1 for all $f$ by construction). Adding this rectangle to $\mathcal{R}$ covers those points; we remove them and proceed. If we cannot find such a sunflower structure, it implies the 1s of each $f$ are arranged in a pseudo-random way with no common core – which typically means each function has few 1s or they are random. But if each $f$ had extremely few 1s (say only $\poly(n)$ many), then the **collision entropy would not be low** (the functions would be very sparse and thus distinguishable) unless they all share those few 1s in common with others – which again implies some structure. Thus, either way, something gives. In formal proof, we may incorporate this into the entropy argument by saying: if we couldn’t find a sunflower, then each assignment of any fixed $I$ of coordinates yields at most one 1-input per function, which sets an upper bound on $|F|$ or distribution distinctness, raising $H_2$.


Therefore, in each step, either we fix a bit to reduce entropy or we find a sunflower core to form a rectangle. Both options guarantee progress: fixing a bit reduces entropy (a measure that can only drop $O(h)$ times), and extracting a sunflower removes many 1s at once (reducing the “mass” of uncovered 1s significantly). We will formalize a measure (like $H_2$ or number of uncovered 1s) that strictly decreases each step.


Add the found rectangle to $\mathcal{R}$ and mark it as covering either a bunch of 1s (if it’s a 1-rectangle) or 0s (if it’s a 0-rectangle). Without loss of generality, focus on covering 1s; at the end, if any input is not in a 1-rectangle for a given $f$, that means that input must be 0 for $f$ (otherwise we missed a 1), so one final rectangle can cover all remaining 0s for that $f$. Usually, a single giant 0-rectangle (the entire space minus all 1-rectangles) works for each $f$. We will ensure no contradiction arises (like an input being claimed as 1 by one function and 0 by another in the same rectangle – low entropy should prevent that by making such disagreements rare or forcing additional rectangles to handle them).

3. 

Termination: We continue until every input of ${0,1}^n$ is covered. This must terminate because in each step we either remove a substantial portion of inputs or strictly reduce entropy. Formally, we can do induction on a well-founded measure: for example, lexicographically on (a) $H_2(F)$ (in multiples of some minimum unit), and (b) the number of uncovered inputs. Each iteration will either reduce (a) or, if (a) can’t go lower, reduce (b). Ultimately, $H_2(F)$ can drop to 0 and then all remaining uncovered points (if any) can be covered by one rectangle (since all functions agree there). Thus a full cover $\mathcal{R}$ is produced. We will have an upper bound on $|\mathcal{R}|$ by summing over how many times we could fix bits plus how many sunflowers we could extract. Because each sunflower removal eliminates a lot of inputs, there can be at most poly(n) such extractions before inputs are exhausted. Each bit fixing is at most $h/\delta$ times. Therefore, the total rectangles $|\mathcal{R}|$ is, say, $\le h/\delta + \poly(n)$. For $\delta$ related to $1/n$ or similar, this is maybe $O(hn + \poly(n)) = \exp(O(\log n))$ which is subexponential. With refined analysis using robust sunflowers (which give $t$ exponential in $w$ rather than factorial), we might get $\delta$ constant and then $|\mathcal{R}| = O(h) + O(\log^c n)$, which is quasipolynomial. The exact count is less important than the qualitative bound $2^{o(n)}$.

4. 

Verification in Lean/Coq: Each step above will be translated into a lemma in the formal proof. For example:

Lemma: If $H_2(F) > 0$, there exists a coordinate $j$ and value $b$ such that $H_2(F|x_j=b) < H_2(F)$. (This will be proven by a counting argument or by examining pair collisions directly.)

Lemma: (Sunflower extraction) If no coordinate reduces entropy (i.e. all functions are symmetric in some sense), then there exists a set of inputs forming a sunflower for the 1-sets of the functions. (This is harder to formalize, but we might not need it if the entropy method always can proceed; however, to be safe and to mirror known lower bounds, we include it.)

Lemma: (Additive structure) If neither entropy can be reduced nor a sunflower exists, then functions must coincide on a subcube (leading to entropy 0 sooner than expected). Essentially, this is the contrapositive: if we haven’t finished covering, then either entropy could drop or a sunflower could be found.

Combining lemmas: we construct $\mathcal{R}$ step by step and prove by induction on steps that the invariant (monochromatic for all $f$, etc.) holds.


The plan within Lean/Coq would mirror this pseudocode:
CoverFamily(F : set of boolfunc, n : ℕ, H2_le_h : H2(F) ≤ h) : set of Subcube := if H2(F) = 0 then return { full_cube }  -- all funcs identical else     if ∃ sunflower_core I and value b such that ∀ f∈F, f|_I ≡ b then        R := define_subcube(I, fixed_values)        F' := restrict_each_function_in F outside R  (functions maybe identical outside if fully covered?)        return {R} ∪ CoverFamily(F', n, H2_le_h')     else        choose j,b via entropy drop lemma        R := { x : x_j = b }   -- subcube of co-dimension 1        F0 := { f|_{x_j=b} : f ∈ F }   -- restrict functions        R_rest := CoverFamily(F0, n-1, H2_le_h')        return R_rest with each subcube extended by x_j=b (and if needed a symmetric branch x_j=¬b later) 
This is a high-level sketch; the actual formal proof will likely use induction rather than recursion due to how Coq/Lean handle termination.

Key Dependencies on Libraries and Prior Work

Our proof will stand on the shoulders of the following theories and libraries:

FinSets and Combinatorics (MathComp or Lean’s finset): For handling families of subsets, sunflowers, etc. We will use results or prove from scratch: Erdős–Rado Sunflower Lemma, Hall’s marriage theorem (if needed for some matching argument in variables), and basic counting (like pigeonhole principle).

Probability/Information Theory: We need a formal notion of collision probability. Lean’s measure_theory or a simple combinatorial probability library can be used. We might avoid heavy measure theory by working with counts and frequencies since everything is finite. For example, we can define $P[f=f'] = \frac{|{x: f(x)=f'(x)}|}{2^n}$ easily and use that.

Fourier Analysis (optional): If additive structure arguments are needed, a bit of Fourier transform on ${0,1}^n$ might be used. There is some formalization of Walsh–Hadamard transform and basic Fourier analysis on the boolean cube in Isabelle/HOL by Eberl (for example) and in Lean’s mathlib (in progress). However, we might not need full Fourier – a counting argument on additive quadruples might suffice for Hegyvári’s part. Still, if needed, we’ll formalize that if a set has no size-$m$ sunflower, then it has at least as many solutions to $a+b=c+d$ (additive energy) as a random set, implying something about collisions across functions.

Existing formal proofs: If any of the needed components (sunflower lemma, etc.) have been formalized in recent years, we will incorporate them rather than redo from scratch. We will survey the literature for formal proofs of combinatorial results up to 2025:

For instance, the formal proof of the sunflower lemma might exist in some form in Coq (we will check the Mathematical Components library or recent student projects).

The PCP theorem formalization efforts might have formalized some covering arguments in simpler contexts (though PCP is about different kind of covering).

We will rely on the community – perhaps reach out to see if someone formalized the sensitivity theorem or junta theorem; otherwise, plan to formalize relevant special cases ourselves.


Publications guiding the proof: We will heavily cite intuitive results from the literature on collision entropy, sensitivity, and additive combinatorics (notably the low-sensitivity algorithms of Gopalan et al.~\cite{GNSWT16}, along with work by Friedgut, Alweiss–Lovett et al., Göös et al., and Hegyvári). These will not be assumed as black-box truth in the formal proof; rather, they inspire our lemmas and we will prove the necessary instances within the proof assistant. However, their presence in literature gives high confidence that each step of our plan is grounded in known mathematics. We will structure our formal proof to mirror these results (for clarity, and possibly to allow cross-verification by reading their proofs and ensuring ours match logically).


Potential Subtleties and Verification Plan

We anticipate some subtle points that require careful handling:


Ensuring rectangles cover all functions uniformly: We must not accidentally construct a rectangle that is monochromatic for some $f\in F$ but not for others. Our invariant is stronger: every chosen rectangle $R$ will come with a label $b_R$ such that $\forall f\in F, \forall x\in R: f(x)=b_R$. To maintain this, when we fix a variable or find a sunflower, we ensure it’s a pattern common to all functions either in their 1s or 0s. This might force us to sometimes split $F$ into subfamilies where functions agree on a pattern and handle them separately. We have to be careful in the proof to not “lose” functions that don’t have a property – in formal terms, we might do case analysis on functions: e.g. those that have 1s in a certain subcube vs those that don’t, and treat them with different rectangles. But since $H_2$ is small, the majority of functions (in measure) will share patterns, allowing a global rectangle. This step is likely where collision entropy is crucial: it quantifies that most pairs of functions collide (agree) more than random, hence there is a large subset of $F$ that agrees on a significant input or pattern. We will formalize a claim like: There exists a subset $F' \subseteq F$ of size $|F'|\ge |F|/2$ such that all $f \in F'$ agree on a particular input $x^$.* (Such a statement can be derived from $H_2$ via averaging arguments.) That gives a rectangle (the single input $x^*$) which is trivial but covers one point for many functions. Then by sunflower extension, we can turn that one point agreement into a bigger subcube agreement. Each such handling we will do with explicit quantifiers and ensure no function is left behind uncovered.


Balancing 1-rectangles and 0-rectangles: We mostly discuss covering 1s because covering 0s is symmetric. But we need to ensure the final cover covers both 1s and 0s of each function. Typically, once all 1s of a function are covered by some rectangles, we can cover all remaining inputs by a 0-rectangle. However, that 0-rectangle might not be monochromatic for other functions (some other function might have a 1 in that region). So we cannot simply take “rest = 0”. Instead, we likely cover 0s similarly by common patterns. One way is to apply the whole algorithm to both the set of 1s and set of 0s symmetrically (or apply it to the family $F$ and also to the family of negations $\bar F$). Since $H_2(F)=H_2(\bar F)$, the same number of rectangles works for covering 0s of $F$ as for covering 1s. So doubling our count, we can cover both. In practice, many rectangles found will be dual-purpose (some subcubes might cover 1s for some functions and 0s for others if they differ, but we avoid that by focusing on one side at a time).


Verifying subexponential bound: After constructing the cover, we need to formally prove $|\mathcal{R}| \le 2^{o(n)}$. In pen-and-paper, we'd argue as above with an inequality. In Lean/Coq, we'd probably provide an explicit (though maybe not tight) bound and show for sufficiently large $n$ it’s bounded by $2^{n/\log n}$ or something. Since $o(n)$ is an asymptotic notion outside the formal system, we will prove a concrete bound like $\exists n_0, \forall n>n_0: |\mathcal{R}| < 2^{n/100}$ (for example). This is enough to conclude subexponential. Verifying this will rely on arithmetic reasoning and possibly the fact that $h$ is constant or grows slower than $n$.


Lean/Coq efficiency: The proof will be long, but we can structure it to reuse lemmas and use automation for repetitive parts (like verifying a rectangle covers a set of inputs is a simple check of each fixed bit’s consistency). We will also test our algorithms on small instances (small $n$ and randomly generated $F$) via computational reflection to build intuition and ensure our formal definitions align with expectation. For example, we might write a Python script (outside Lean) to try to cover some small function families and see the cover sets it finds, then ensure our lemmas would indeed allow those steps.


Collaboration with mathematicians: Because formalizing new results can be tricky, we will stay in close contact with the authors of the results we’re building on (if possible) to clarify any ambiguities. For instance, Lovett’s insight into robust sunflowers or Hegyvári’s additive lemma might not be fully captured in their papers but we can confirm with them if our interpretation is correct. This will prevent us from going down a wrong formal path (which can be very time-consuming).

Verification Plan: We plan to verify incrementally:

First, formalize simpler lemmas: basic sunflower lemma, a simplified junta lemma for exactly low influence, etc., in isolation.

Then formalize a version of the lemma for extremely structured families (like all functions are monotone or something) as a test.

Next, implement the recursive cover algorithm in Coq’s Gallina or Lean’s meta language and use small test families to debug the logic (this can often be done by extracting and running on small inputs).

Finally, prove by induction that the algorithm always produces a valid cover and respects the bounds.


Each component’s verification will be reviewed and optimized. Since the final goal is significant (P ≠ NP proof), we will also document each formal lemma clearly, so it can be human-checked against the literature for trustworthiness. The plan emphasizes modularity (each lemma proven separately) and correspondence with known arguments, which reduces the risk of logical errors. By the end, we expect to have a certified proof of FCE-Lemma, and thus have removed the final barrier to a formal proof that P ≠ NP under the proposed framework.
