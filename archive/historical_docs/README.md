# Historical documentation (archived)

This folder contains legacy/archival documentation preserved for provenance.
These files describe earlier states of the project (e.g., GapMCSP-era analysis
or past feasibility reports) and **do not** represent the current active
pipeline. For the up-to-date status, see the root `README.md`,
`AXIOM_ANALYSIS_FINAL.md`, and `TODO.md`.
