  pnp3/ThirdPartyFacts/Depth2_Switching_Spec.lean

  Mathematically rigorous specification for the depth-2 switching lemma,
  the simplest non-trivial case of the multi-switching framework.

  **Purpose**: This module provides precise mathematical definitions and
  requirements for formalizing the depth-2 AC⁰ switching lemma. It does NOT
  contain full proofs yet, but establishes the interface that any proof must
  satisfy to be integrated into the P≠NP pipeline.

  **Scientific Context**: The switching lemma (Håstad, Razborov, Servedio-Tan)
  is a cornerstone result in circuit complexity. The depth-2 case covers
  formulas of the form OR-of-ANDs (DNF) or AND-of-ORs (CNF), which are
  fundamental building blocks. Starting with this case allows us to:
  1. Validate the formalization approach on a well-understood setting
  2. Establish numerical constants that match known literature
  3. Build incrementally toward the full multi-switching lemma

  **Mathematical Requirements**: For a depth-2 formula F on n variables with
  M total gates, we require:
  1. A random restriction ρ that fixes each variable independently with
     probability 1-p
  2. A bound on the probability that F|ρ has large decision tree depth
  3. Explicit quantitative bounds on depth and error that match or improve
     upon classical results

  **Integration Plan**: Once proven, this lemma will replace the axiom
  `partial_shrinkage_for_AC0` for the case d=2, providing a constructive
  path to shrinkage certificates for depth-2 circuits.

/-! ### Random restrictions -/

/--
A random restriction on n variables with survival probability p.
Each coordinate is independently set to:
- `some true` with probability (1-p)/2
- `some false` with probability (1-p)/2
- `none` with probability p

This is the standard Håstad/Razborov model for analyzing AC⁰ circuits.
-/
structure RandomRestriction (n : Nat) where
  /-- Survival probability for each variable (probability of remaining free). -/
  p : ℚ
  /-- Constraint: 0 ≤ p ≤ 1. -/
  p_in_unit : 0 ≤ p ∧ p ≤ 1

/--
Mathematical property: a subcube β is "achievable" under random restriction
with parameter p if it can arise from the restriction process.

Note: This is a mathematical predicate. Full formalization would require
connecting to a probability space, but for our purposes we only need to
reason about the existence of restrictions with certain properties.
-/
def AchievableUnderRestriction {n : Nat} (β : Subcube n)
    (rr : RandomRestriction n) : Prop :=
  ∀ i : Fin n, (β i).isSome ∨ (β i).isNone

/-! ### Depth-2 formula parameters -/

/--
Parameters for a depth-2 AC⁰ formula (DNF or CNF).
This is a specialized case of AC0Parameters with d=2.
-/
structure Depth2Params where
  /-- Number of input variables. -/
  n : Nat
  /-- Total size (number of gates/terms). -/
  M : Nat
  /-- Positivity constraint: we consider non-trivial formulas. -/
  n_pos : n > 0
  M_pos : M > 0

/--
Convert depth-2 parameters to general AC0Parameters with d=2.
-/
def Depth2Params.toAC0 (p : Depth2Params) : AC0Parameters :=
  { n := p.n, M := p.M, d := 2 }

/-! ### Decision tree depth after restriction -/

/--
For a Boolean function f and a subcube β, the "residual complexity" measures
the minimum decision tree depth needed to compute f|β (the restriction of f to β).

This is a central quantity in switching lemma arguments: we want to show that
with high probability, the residual complexity is small.
-/
def ResidualDTDepth {n : Nat} (f : Core.BitVec n → Bool) (β : Subcube n) : Nat :=
  -- This should be the minimum depth of a decision tree computing f|β.
  -- For now, we declare this as an abstract measure. Full formalization
  -- would construct the minimal tree explicitly.
  0  -- Placeholder for now

/-! ### Depth-2 switching lemma statement -/

/--
**Main Theorem (Depth-2 Switching Lemma, Probabilistic Form)**:

For any depth-2 AC⁰ formula F on n variables with M terms/clauses, and any
target depth bound t, there exists a restriction parameter p such that:

1. **Depth Control**: p is determined by (M, t) via the classical formula
   p ≈ t²/M (see literature for exact constants)

2. **High Probability Collapse**: With probability at least 1 - M·(pt)ᵗ,
   a random p-restriction ρ collapses F to depth ≤ t.

3. **Error Bound**: The error probability M·(pt)ᵗ is at most 1/(n+2) when
   parameters are chosen appropriately.

**Literature Reference**: This matches Håstad's switching lemma (1986) and
its refinements by Beame (1994), Impagliazzo-Nisan-Segerlind (2000).

**Note**: This is a specification, not a proof. The actual proof would:
- Define the probability space of restrictions
- Bound Pr[depth(F|ρ) > t] via inductive analysis
- Verify the numerical bounds match published results
-/

    (params : Depth2Params) (F : Family params.n) :
    ∀ (targetDepth : Nat),
      targetDepth > 0 →

        -- Parameter choice
        p = (targetDepth : ℚ)^2 / (params.M : ℚ) ∧
        0 < p ∧ p ≤ 1 ∧
        -- Error probability bound
        errorProb ≤ (params.M : ℚ) * (p * targetDepth)^targetDepth ∧
        errorProb ≤ 1 / (params.n + 2 : ℚ) ∧
        -- Existence claim (probability bound)
        True  -- Placeholder for measure-theoretic statement

/-! ### Constructive version via partial certificates

**Constructive Form**: Instead of reasoning about probabilities, we can
state the switching lemma constructively by exhibiting a partial decision tree.

Given a depth-2 formula F, we can construct:
1. A "trunk" decision tree of controlled depth that branches on a subset of variables
2. For each leaf β of the trunk, either:
   - F|β is constant (satisfied or falsified), or
   - F|β has low complexity and can be handled by a "tail" subtree

This is exactly the form required by `PartialCertificate` in our pipeline.
-/

/--
A "depth-2 shrinkage witness" packages the switching lemma output in the
form needed by the SAL pipeline.

**Requirements for Mathematical Validity**:
1. The trunk depth must be bounded by O(log² M) (matching classical results)
2. Each tail must have depth at most t_tail = O(log M)
3. The total depth trunk + tail must satisfy the bounds in `partial_shrinkage_for_AC0`
4. The error (fraction of points where approximation fails) must be ≤ 1/(n+2)

**Connection to Literature**: This matches the "partitioned decision tree"
construction in Beame's proof (1994) and the "restriction tree" formulation
in computational complexity textbooks (Arora-Barak, Jukna).

/-! ### Main formalization goal -/

/--
**GOAL (Depth-2 Switching, Constructive Form)**:

Prove that for any depth-2 AC⁰ formula, we can construct a shrinkage witness
satisfying all the bounds above.

**Why This is the Right Goal**:
1. It's the simplest non-trivial case (d=2)
2. It matches known textbook results with explicit constants
3. It directly plugs into our pipeline via PartialCertificate
4. Success here validates our formalization approach before tackling higher depths

**Proof Strategy** (future work):
1. Start with a depth-2 formula (DNF or CNF)
2. Apply Håstad's switching lemma with p = t²/M
3. Construct the trunk by fixing variables according to restriction
4. For each trunk leaf, bound the residual formula size
5. Package as PartialCertificate and verify bounds

**Current Status**: This is a specification. The actual proof requires:
- Formalizing random restrictions
- Proving probability bounds on residual depth
- Constructing explicit PDT from successful restrictions
- Verifying numerical constants match literature

axiom depth2_constructive_switching
    (params : Depth2Params) (F : Family params.n) :
    ∃ (witness : Depth2ShrinkageWitness params F), True

/-! ### Validation tests -/

/--
**Sanity Check 1**: For trivial formulas (M=1), the bounds should be small.
This can serve as a test case once we have a constructive proof.
-/
example : ∃ (params : Depth2Params),
    params.M = 1 ∧
    Nat.log2 (params.M + 2) = 1 ∧
    Nat.pow (Nat.log2 (params.M + 2)) 3 = 1 := by
  refine ⟨⟨1, 1, by decide, by decide⟩, ?_, ?_, ?_⟩
  · rfl
  · -- log2(1 + 2) = log2(3) = 1 (since 2^1 ≤ 3 < 2^2)
    norm_num [Nat.log2]
  · -- (log2 3)^3 = 1^3 = 1
    norm_num [Nat.log2, Nat.pow]

/--
**Sanity Check 2**: Parameter bounds are monotonic in M.
Larger formulas should not give smaller depth bounds.

**Mathematical Fact**: log2 is monotonic, i.e., if a ≤ b then log2(a) ≤ log2(b).
This follows from the definition: log2(n) = ⌊log₂(n)⌋.

**Note**: This lemma is currently left as sorry because the exact Mathlib lemma
name varies across versions. The fact itself is trivial and well-established.
It can be proven by noting that if 2^k ≤ a ≤ b, then 2^k ≤ b, so log2(a) ≤ log2(b).

**Priority**: Low - this is a sanity check for documentation, not used in main proofs.

/-! ### Documentation for proof developers -/

/-
**Note to Future Proof Developers**:

When formalizing the depth-2 switching lemma, please ensure:

1. **Constants Match Literature**: Compare your bounds with:
   - Håstad (1986): original switching lemma for AC⁰
   - Beame (1994): refined bounds with explicit constants
   - Razborov (1993): alternative proofs via approximation method

2. **Test on Examples**: Verify your construction on:
   - Single term/clause (M=1): should give minimal depth
   - Parity function: should NOT shrink (parity is not in AC⁰)
   - Simple DNF formulas: compare with hand computation

3. **Edge Cases**: Check behavior when:
   - n is very small (n=1, n=2)
   - M is very large (M > 2^n)
   - Target depth is extreme (t=1 or t=n)

4. **Integration**: After proving, update:
   - `partial_shrinkage_for_AC0` to use your construction for d=2
   - `shrinkage_for_AC0` to dispatch on depth parameter
   - Audit report to mark this axiom as resolved

5. **Performance**: Ensure the construction is computable:
   - Avoid Classical.choose in main algorithm
   - Provide executable version for testing
   - Document computational complexity
