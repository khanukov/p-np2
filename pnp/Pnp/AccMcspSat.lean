-- ==================
--
-- Outline of the meet-in-the-middle SAT algorithm for `ACC^0 ∘ MCSP`.
-- This module gathers a few definitions and lemma stubs that would
-- connect the cover from the Family Collision–Entropy Lemma
-- (Lemma B) with a subexponential SAT algorithm.
-- All statements are currently placeholders and the proofs are omitted.

/-- Schematic meet-in-the-middle SAT algorithm using a rectangular cover of the
MCSP truth tables. The algorithm loops over the rectangles and computes partial
sums on the left and right halves. Whenever a non-zero product is detected the
circuit is satisfiable. This stub merely returns `false`. -/
