This file contains axioms relating an MCSP lower bound to standard
complexity separations.  The actual results are omitted.

Lower bound for the minimum circuit size problem (MCSP).
`MCSP_lower_bound ε` means that MCSP on inputs of size `N` requires
circuits of size at least `N^{1 + ε}`. Formal details are omitted; see
Theorem 1.4 of "Hardness Magnification Near State-of-the-Art Lower
Bounds" (2021).

axiom AC0_consequence : Prop

/--
Magnification for AC0: if MCSP has a lower bound of the form `MCSP_lower_bound ε`
for some `ε > 0`, then `AC0_consequence` follows.  This is a placeholder for the
actual hardness magnification statement in AC0 circuits.

theorem magnification_AC0_MCSP :
  (∃ ε > 0, MCSP_lower_bound ε) → AC0_consequence :=
by
  intro h
  -- Proof would invoke hardness magnification results for Gap-MCSP
  sorry

axiom PH_collapse : Prop

/-- Karp-Lipton theorem: NP ⊆ P/poly implies a collapse of PH. -/
theorem karp_lipton : (NP ⊆ Ppoly) → PH_collapse := by
  intro h
  -- Standard argument using non-uniform advice
  sorry

/--
If there exists an ε > 0 with an MCSP lower bound, then P ≠ NP.  The proof
would combine `magnification_AC0_MCSP` with known implications of MCSP lower
bounds for circuit complexity.
-/
theorem P_ne_NP_of_MCSP_bound :
  (∃ ε > 0, MCSP_lower_bound ε) → P ≠ NP := by
  intro h
  -- Sketch: hardness magnification shows NP ⊄ Circuit[poly]
  -- Together with standard complexity arguments we conclude P ≠ NP.
  sorry

example : ¬ (∃ ε > 0, MCSP_lower_bound ε) ∨ P ≠ NP := by
