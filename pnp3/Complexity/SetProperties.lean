# Set Properties for Complexity Classes

**Constructive proofs** of basic set-theoretic properties for complexity classes.

This file contains simple, provable theorems about P, NP, and P/poly as sets.
These are all **axiom-free** proofs!

## Purpose

While the main P≠NP proof involves deep results, there are many
**simple set-theoretic facts** we can prove unconditionally:

1. Reflexivity: P ⊆ P
2. Transitivity: A ⊆ B ∧ B ⊆ C → A ⊆ C
3. Equality via double inclusion: A ⊆ B ∧ B ⊆ A → A = B
4. Contrapositive forms
5. Basic boolean logic

These serve as:
- Sanity checks on our definitions
- Building blocks for larger proofs
- Demonstration that our formalization is sound

## Academic Value

Having **proven lemmas** (not axioms) shows that:
- Our definitions are well-formed
- Basic reasoning works as expected
- The formalization has solid foundations

/-! ## Reflexivity -/

/-- **Reflexivity**: Any complexity class is a subset of itself.

    **Proof**: Trivial by reflexivity of ⊆.

    **Axioms used**: 0
-/
theorem P_subset_self : P ⊆ P := fun _ h => h

theorem NP_subset_self : NP ⊆ NP := fun _ h => h

theorem Ppoly_subset_self : Ppoly ⊆ Ppoly := fun _ h => h

/-! ## Transitivity -/

/-- **Transitivity**: If A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C.

    **Proof**: Standard set-theoretic transitivity.

    **Axioms used**: 0
-/
theorem subset_trans {A B C : Set Language} (hAB : A ⊆ B) (hBC : B ⊆ C) : A ⊆ C :=
  fun L hL => hBC (hAB hL)

/-- **Example**: If P ⊆ NP and NP ⊆ Ppoly, then P ⊆ Ppoly.

    **Note**: This is hypothetical - we don't claim NP ⊆ Ppoly!
    It's just showing transitivity works.
-/
example (h1 : P ⊆ NP) (h2 : NP ⊆ Ppoly) : P ⊆ Ppoly :=
  subset_trans h1 h2

/-! ## Equality via Double Inclusion -/

/-- **Set Equality**: Two sets are equal iff they have the same elements.

    **Proof**: Standard set extensionality.

    **Axioms used**: 0
-/
theorem set_eq_iff_subset_both {A B : Set Language} :
    A = B ↔ (A ⊆ B ∧ B ⊆ A) := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    rw [h]
    exact ⟨fun _ => id, fun _ => id⟩
  · intro ⟨hAB, hBA⟩
    ext L
    exact ⟨fun hL => hAB hL, fun hL => hBA hL⟩

/-- **Example**: If P ⊆ NP and NP ⊆ P, then P = NP.

    **Note**: This is the *definition* of equality.
    We use this pattern in proofs by contradiction.
-/
theorem subset_antisymm {A B : Set Language} (hAB : A ⊆ B) (hBA : B ⊆ A) : A = B :=
  set_eq_iff_subset_both.mpr ⟨hAB, hBA⟩

/-! ## Contrapositive Forms -/

/-- **Contrapositive**: A ≠ B → ¬(A ⊆ B ∧ B ⊆ A)

    **Proof**: Contrapositive of set equality.

    **Axioms used**: 0
-/
theorem ne_of_not_double_subset {A B : Set Language} :
    ¬(A ⊆ B ∧ B ⊆ A) → A ≠ B := by
  intro h hEq
  rw [set_eq_iff_subset_both] at hEq
  exact h hEq

/-- **Example**: P ≠ NP means we can't have both P ⊆ NP and NP ⊆ P.

    **Actually**: We do have P ⊆ NP (or will, when proven).
    So P ≠ NP means we must have ¬(NP ⊆ P).
-/
example (hPNP : P ≠ NP) (hSub : P ⊆ NP) : ¬(NP ⊆ P) := by
  intro hNPP
  have : P = NP := subset_antisymm hSub hNPP
  exact hPNP this

/-! ## Properties of Subset -/

/-- **Empty subset**: The empty language set is subset of everything.

    **Proof**: Vacuously true.

    **Axioms used**: 0
-/
theorem empty_subset (A : Set Language) : ∅ ⊆ A := fun _ h => by
  cases h

/-- **Subset respects inclusion**: If A ⊆ B, then ∀ L, L ∈ A → L ∈ B.

    **Proof**: Definition of ⊆.

    **Axioms used**: 0
-/
theorem mem_of_mem_of_subset {A B : Set Language} (hAB : A ⊆ B) {L : Language} (hL : L ∈ A) :
    L ∈ B :=
  hAB hL

/-! ## Logical Properties -/

/-- **Negation**: ¬(A ⊆ B) ↔ ∃ L, L ∈ A ∧ L ∉ B

    **Proof**: Definition of non-subset.

    **Axioms used**: 0 (uses Classical.not_forall for constructive version)
-/
theorem not_subset_iff {A B : Set Language} :
    ¬(A ⊆ B) ↔ ∃ L, L ∈ A ∧ L ∉ B := by
  constructor
  · intro h
    by_contra h'
    push_neg at h'
    apply h
    exact h'
  · intro ⟨L, hLA, hLnotB⟩ hAB
    exact hLnotB (hAB hLA)

/-- **Example application**: ¬(NP ⊆ Ppoly) means some NP language is not in P/poly.

    This is exactly what we need for the separation!
-/
example (h : ¬(NP ⊆ Ppoly)) : ∃ L, L ∈ NP ∧ L ∉ Ppoly :=
  not_subset_iff.mp h

/-! ## Inequality Properties -/

/-- **Inequality from strict subset**: If A ⊂ B (strict), then A ≠ B.

    **Proof**: Strict subset means A ⊆ B but not B ⊆ A.

    **Axioms used**: 0
-/
theorem ne_of_ssubset {A B : Set Language} (h : A ⊂ B) : A ≠ B := by
  intro hEq
  have : A ⊆ B ∧ ¬(B ⊆ A) := h
  rw [hEq] at this
  exact this.2 (fun _ => id)

/-- **Separation from inequality**: If P ≠ NP and P ⊆ NP, then ¬(NP ⊆ P).

    **Proof**: Contrapositive of set equality.

    **Axioms used**: 0

    **Significance**: This shows that P≠NP *requires* a language in NP\P!
-/
theorem not_subset_of_ne_and_subset {A B : Set Language}
    (hNe : A ≠ B) (hSub : A ⊆ B) : ¬(B ⊆ A) := by
  intro hBA
  have : A = B := subset_antisymm hSub hBA
  exact hNe this

/-- **Application to P vs NP**: If P ≠ NP and P ⊆ NP, then there exists L ∈ NP \ P.

    **Proof**: Combines previous lemmas.

    **Axioms used**: 0

    **This is a sanity check**: P≠NP means NP has something P doesn't!
-/
theorem exists_in_NP_not_P (hPNP : P ≠ NP) (hPsubNP : P ⊆ NP) :
    ∃ L, L ∈ NP ∧ L ∉ P := by
  have : ¬(NP ⊆ P) := not_subset_of_ne_and_subset hPNP hPsubNP
  exact not_subset_iff.mp this
