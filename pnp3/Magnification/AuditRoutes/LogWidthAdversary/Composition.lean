# Log-width adversary — final composition

S11 integration for `seed_packs/fp3b1_log_width_hardwiring_lift/`.
This module composes the parallel-engineer outputs into the canonical
diversity theorem that lifts `outputs/nogolog.jsonl::NOGO-000003`
from `status="needs_review"` to `status="formalized"`.

The composition uses Path A (Nat.log2 width) of the seed pack:

* `Width_NatLog2` (S1) — the three width-helper theorems for
  `Nat.log2 (n + 1)`.
* `Family_NatLog2` (S6) — the `prefixAnd`-based adversary family
  whose support is the first `Nat.log2 (n + 1)` input coordinates.
* `Diversity_BelowN` (S9) — parametric reducer for the second
  diversity conjunct.
* `Diversity_Unbounded` (S8 retry) — parametric reducer for the
  first diversity conjunct.

Path B (power-of-two slice via `Family_PowOfTwoSlice`) is also
in the tree as a parallel realisation; it is left wired but not
used by the canonical composition below.  Both paths reach the
same conclusion; we ship Path A because it composes from S1
directly.

The proof has no proof-suspension placeholders, no `axiom`, and stays inside
audit-only zones.  It does NOT touch the trust root, does NOT
construct any `gap_from_*` bridge, does NOT promote
`ProvenanceFilter_v1`, and does NOT create a `pnp3/Candidates/`
directory.

The proof is structural induction on `k`.  At the successor step,
the new leaf `input ⟨k, _⟩` is fresh with respect to the inductive
support (every index in there has value `< k`, by
`prefixAnd_support_lt`), so the singleton-vs-set union is
disjoint and the cardinality adds. -/

## Top-level composition

The diversity theorem itself lives outside the deep
`FP3Attempt.FP3b1.LogWidthAdversary` namespace so the seed pack's
expected signature is reachable without a long path prefix.  The
witness it operates on is the S6 record `adversaryWitness_v_natlog2`,
which sits inside `FP3b1.LogWidthAdversary` per S6's design.

/-- **The S11 integration theorem.**

`adversaryWitness_v_natlog2`, the polynomial-size truth-table-shaped
family on a `Nat.log2 (n + 1)`-window of inputs, satisfies the
candidate filter `FP3Attempt.InSupportFunctionalDiversity`.

Combined with
`FP3Attempt.InSupportFunctionalDiversity_excludes_uniformPolyBound`
(the existing Outcome-A obstruction against constant-`polyBound`
families), this proves that the candidate filter as stated does
NOT exclude **the prefix-AND family on a `Nat.log2 (n+1)`-window
of inputs** — a polynomial-size, syntactically log-width shape
whose support is exactly the first `Nat.log2 (n+1)` coordinates.

**Scope (read this carefully).**  This theorem closes the
prefix-AND specialisation of NOGO-000003.  It does NOT yet
formalise the full original NOGO-000003 sketch, which asked
for arbitrary all-essential `f_n : Bitstring k(n) → Bool`
packaged via `FormulaCircuit.rename σ_n (ttFormula f_n)`.  The
prefix-AND payload is the simplest truth-table-shaped witness
satisfying the candidate filter; arbitrary `ttFormula` payload
is the topic of the follow-up seed pack
`seed_packs/fp3b2_arbitrary_logwidth_tt_payload/`.

The corresponding NoGoLog upgrade chain is
`NOGO-000003 (needs_review)
 → NOGO-000004 (formalized; this theorem)
 → NOGO-000005 (formalized scope-correction)
 → [open: NOGO-000006 = full arbitrary-payload upgrade]`.

A future `ProvenanceFilter_v2` MUST eventually exclude both the
prefix-AND specialisation (this theorem) AND the arbitrary-
payload generalisation (fp3b2 target) by an argument that does
not reduce to support-cardinality counting.  Kernel-checked,
no proof-suspension placeholders, no `axiom`. -/
