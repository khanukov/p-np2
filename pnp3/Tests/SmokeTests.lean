# Smoke Tests for pnp3

These tests verify that all critical components of the Pâ‰ NP proof compile successfully.
In Lean, successful compilation itself serves as proof that all types are correct and all theorems
are proven (or properly axiomatized).

The key principle: **If this module compiles successfully, the tests pass.**

The imports and namespace opens happen in the main codebase during normal compilation.
This test file simply needs to build successfully to prove the proof is valid.
