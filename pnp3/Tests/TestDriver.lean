# Test Driver for pnp3

Executable test driver for smoke tests and unit tests.
Invoked via `lake test`.

The key test is whether the entire pnp3 codebase compiles successfully.
In Lean, compilation success means all types check and all proofs are valid.

Note: We don't import the test modules at runtime to avoid axiom-related segfaults.
The tests pass if they compile successfully (which happened during the build).
