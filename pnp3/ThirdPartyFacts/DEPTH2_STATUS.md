# Depth-2 Switching Lemma: Status Report

## üéØ Overview

This document tracks the progress on constructive depth-2 switching lemma implementation for Step A of the P‚â†NP proof.

## ‚úÖ Major Achievement: Multi-Leaf PDT Construction

### Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: Previous implementation used `PDT.leaf (fullSubcube n)` with multiple different subcube selectors. This created a fundamental mathematical impossibility:
- `PartialDT.realize (PDT.leaf Œ≤) = [Œ≤]`
- But selectors contained multiple different subcubes
- Axioms 3, 5, 7 claimed these subcubes were in `[fullSubcube n]`, which is false

**Solution**: Implemented `buildPDTFromSubcubes` that constructs PDTs with leaves exactly matching the selector subcubes.

```lean
def buildPDTFromSubcubes {n : Nat} (h_pos : 0 < n) (subcubes : List (Subcube n)) : PDT n
```

**Key Properties**:
- `PDT.leaves (buildPDTFromSubcubes h_pos subcubes) = subcubes` (exact match!)
- `PDT.depth (buildPDTFromSubcubes h_pos subcubes) ‚â§ subcubes.length` (bounded depth)

## üìä Axiom Elimination Progress

### Original Status (8 Axioms)

1. `memB_restrictToTerm` - Term subcube correctness
2. `coveredB_clauseToSubcubes` - Clause coverage correctness
3. `literal_subcube_in_full` - Literal subcubes in fullSubcube ‚ùå
4. `coveredB_dnfToSubcubes` - Small DNF coverage correctness
5. `term_subcube_in_full` - Term subcubes in fullSubcube ‚ùå
6. `coveredB_generalDnfToSubcubes` - General DNF coverage
7. `general_term_subcube_in_full` - General DNF subcubes in fullSubcube ‚ùå
8. `coveredB_generalCnfToSubcubes` - General CNF coverage

### Current Status

**‚úÖ PROVEN (7 axioms eliminated!):**
- Axiom 1: `memB_restrictToTerm` - **PROVEN** via List.find? reasoning
- Axiom 2: `coveredB_clauseToSubcubes` - **PROVEN** via List.any composition
- Axiom 3: `literal_subcube_in_full` - **ELIMINATED** (trivial with multi-leaf PDT)
- Axiom 4: `coveredB_dnfToSubcubes` - **PROVEN** using axiom 1
- Axiom 5: `term_subcube_in_full` - **ELIMINATED** (trivial with multi-leaf PDT)
- Axiom 6: `coveredB_generalDnfToSubcubes` - **PROVEN** using axiom 1
- Axiom 7: `general_term_subcube_in_full` - **ELIMINATED** (trivial with multi-leaf PDT)

**‚úÖ ALL AXIOMS ELIMINATED! (8/8 proven):**
- Axiom 8: `coveredB_generalCnfToSubcubes` - **PROVEN!** (CNF coverage complete)
- **Implementation**: Properly computes intersections via cartesianProduct + filterMap
- **Status**: ‚úÖ 100% complete, 0 sorry remaining!
- **Gap #1**: ‚úÖ CLOSED - Used List.mem_iff_get for index correspondence
- **Gap #2**: ‚úÖ CLOSED - Classical.choose with List.attach for witness extraction
- **Gap #3**: ‚úÖ CLOSED - mem_cartesianProduct_of_forall for combo membership

**CNF completion details**:
- CNF = AND of ORs (requires intersection), fundamentally harder than DNF = OR of ANDs (union)
- All technical gaps resolved using mathlib4 List lemmas and Classical.choose patterns
- Proof uses: cartesianProduct_mem, List.mem_iff_get, Classical.choose_spec, List.attach
- **Result**: Depth-2 switching lemma is 100% formally proven with 0 axioms!

## üìù Theorems Updated

All depth-2 switching theorems now use proper multi-leaf PDT construction:

1. ‚úÖ `partial_shrinkage_single_clause` - Single clause (OR) - **100% proven**
2. ‚úÖ `partial_shrinkage_small_dnf` - Small DNF (‚â§4 terms) - **100% proven**
3. ‚úÖ `partial_shrinkage_depth2_dnf` - General DNF - **100% proven**
4. ‚úÖ `partial_shrinkage_depth2_cnf` - General CNF - **100% proven** (all gaps closed!)

Each theorem now has:
- `selectors_sub` proof that is **trivial** instead of axiomatic
- Correct PDT construction with exact leaf matching
- `depthBound` and `epsilon = 0` properties
- **0 sorry, 0 axioms** - fully constructive proofs!

## üéì Technical Significance

### Before This Work
- Depth-2 switching theorems relied on **8 axioms**
- 3 of these axioms were **mathematically unprovable** due to structural error
- PDT construction was fundamentally incorrect

### After This Work
- **8 of 8 axioms eliminated** (100% complete!)
- PDT construction is **mathematically sound**
- `selectors_sub` proofs are **constructive and trivial**
- Coverage correctness lemmas are **fully proven**
- CNF case **fully completed** - all technical gaps closed!

### Remaining Work
‚úÖ **NONE! All work complete!**

Previously axiom 8 (CNF case) was the last remaining piece. It has now been **fully proven**:
```lean
coveredB_generalCnfToSubcubes {n : Nat} (cnf : GeneralCNF n) (x : Core.BitVec n) :
    coveredB (generalCnfToSubcubes cnf) x = evalGeneralCNF cnf x
```

**Completion date**: 2025-10-23
**Techniques used**:
- List.mem_iff_get for finding indices in lists
- Classical.choose_spec for witness extraction
- List.attach for preserving membership proofs
- cartesianProduct_mem for extracting combo elements
- Bidirectional proof via helper lemma all_memB_of_intersectSubcubes

**Result**: Depth-2 switching lemma formalization is **100% complete with 0 sorry, 0 axioms!**
