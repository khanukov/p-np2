# Depth-2 Status (Historical)

This file is a historical progress report for a local depth-2 subtrack.
It is not the source of truth for current global project status.

For current proof-state and blocker tracking, use:

- `STATUS.md`
- `TODO.md`
- `AXIOMS_FINAL_LIST.md`
- `pnp3/Docs/MultiSwitching_DepthInduction_TODO.md`

Scope note:
- Depth-2 local progress does not by itself close global I-4.
- Historical caveat in this file predates current AC0-path closure statements.
  For the active project status of I-4, always use top-level `STATUS.md`.
