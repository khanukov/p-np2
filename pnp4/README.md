# pnp4

`pnp4` is a separate Lean-library track for algorithms-to-lower-bounds work.

Scope split:

- `pnp3`: SAL / locality / Route-A/B frontier.
- `pnp4`: algorithmic lower bounds / MCSP / Williams-style route.

Current goal:

- build a verified algorithms-to-lower-bounds track without polluting the
  active `pnp3` research frontier.

Milestones:

1. Formalize circuit-class and truth-table MCSP skeletons.
2. Formalize the coin-problem interface and MCSP-to-coin reduction.
3. Add an explicit `AC0[p]` coin-lower-bound contract layer and derive the
   corresponding MCSP threshold-oracle exclusion theorem surface.
4. Add a local-PRG transfer layer and derive counting-closed exclusion theorems
   for tree-MCSP threshold oracles.
5. Add a paper-facing local-PRG hardness-spec layer for published MCSP lower
   bounds.
6. Formalize a Williams-style SAT-algorithm-to-lower-bound schema.

Ultimate bridge target:

```text
MCSP ∉ PpolyDAG ⇒ NP ⊄ PpolyDAG ⇒ P ≠ NP
```

Next progress target:

1. Treat the CKLM formula/local-PRG route as an exact-slice lower-bound
   transfer, not as a `PpolyFormula` asymptotic source.  The current
   `N^{2-o(1)}` envelope cannot beat every polynomial-size formula family.
2. Make the next asymptotic milestone the `AC^0[p]` coin route for fixed depth:
   prove that its paper-facing `exp(N^(0.49 / d))` envelope beats every
   polynomial-size bound at truth-table lengths, then derive a non-vacuous
   external-class MCSP lower bound.
3. Keep the final `PpolyDAG` bridge frozen until an explicit `NP` language lower
   bound against `PpolyDAG` is available.

Honesty policy:

`pnp4` does not claim unconditional `P ≠ NP` unless it proves `MCSP ∉ PpolyDAG`
or another explicit `NP` language lower bound against `PpolyDAG` without hidden
assumptions.

Current reference point for the coin-problem track:

- Golovnev, Ilango, Impagliazzo, Kabanets, Kolokolova, Tal,
  `AC^0[p] Lower Bounds Against MCSP via the Coin Problem`, ICALP 2019 /
  ECCC 2019.

The current `pnp4` code proves reusable transfer/consequence layers for that
route, but it still does not claim the concentration, hybrid, or concrete
`AC^0[p]` lower-bound ingredients.  Those remain explicit published contracts.

Current theorem surface status:

- `CoinProblem.lean`: exact finite-distribution semantics for the coin problem.
- `MCSPCoinReduction.lean`: threshold-oracle reduction surface from MCSP to coin
  distinguishing on truth tables.
- `MCSPCoinReductionContract.lean`: smaller theorem-facing half-vs-fair
  reduction contract, fixing a threshold schedule and the exact MCSP slice
  coin-solving obligation via separate low-acceptance, fair-acceptance, and
  advantage-gap certificates.
- `AC0pCoinLowerBound.lean`: explicit contract layer for published `AC^0[p]`
  coin lower bounds, in size-bounded form.
- `MCSP_AC0p_Final.lean`: consequence layer saying that, under the `AC^0[p]`
  lower-bound contract and either a concrete reduction witness or the smaller
  reduction contract, the corresponding exact MCSP slice has the expected
  size-lower-bound form.
- `MCSP_AC0p_Quantitative.lean`: paper-facing quantitative shell for the
  published `exp(N^(0.49 / d))` envelope, with explicit bias-gap and advantage
  profile metadata for the half-vs-fair coin regime.
- `LocalPRG.lean`: truth-table local-PRG surface with easy-image and
  pseudorandomness interfaces against size-bounded circuit classes.
- `MCSP_LocalPRG_Transfer.lean`: proved Shannon-counting upper bound for
  uniform acceptance of exact tree-MCSP threshold oracles and the resulting
  local-PRG transfer contradiction theorem surface.
- `LocalPRGHardnessSpec.lean`: paper-facing published-route layer packaging
  `LocalPRGHardnessSpec`, target family models, and exact-threshold exclusion
  theorems for published local-PRG regimes.
- `FormulaCircuitTargetModel.lean`: concrete target model connecting the new
  `pnp4` circuit-class interface to the in-repo `pnp3` formula syntax.
- `FormulaCircuitPublishedLowerBound.lean`: theorem-facing published lower-bound
  shortcut for already-final exact slice statements.
- `MCSP_Formula_Final.lean` and `MCSP_Formula_Theorem2Quantitative.lean`: CKLM
  formula-route source contracts and exact-slice consequences.  The preferred
  mainline is now
  `CKLMFormulaCircuitLocalPRGSourceContract → FormulaCircuitPublishedLowerBoundContract → SizeLowerBound`.
- `FormulaCircuitAsymptotic.lean`: optional bridge from slice lower bounds to
  `¬ PpolyFormula`, only under an explicit table-length escape hypothesis.
  It also records the guardrail that the current CKLM `N^{2-o(1)}` envelope
  cannot discharge that asymptotic growth hypothesis by itself.
- `BridgeToPpolyDAG.lean`: final bridge shell from a verified `NP` language
  lower bound against `PpolyDAG` to the existing `pnp3` `P ≠ NP` target.
