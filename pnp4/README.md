# pnp4

`pnp4` is a separate Lean-library track for algorithms-to-lower-bounds work.

Scope split:

- `pnp3`: SAL / locality / Route-A/B frontier.
- `pnp4`: algorithmic lower bounds / MCSP / Williams-style route.

Current goal:

- build a verified algorithms-to-lower-bounds track without polluting the
  active `pnp3` research frontier.

Milestones:

1. Formalize circuit-class and truth-table MCSP skeletons.
2. Formalize the coin-problem interface and MCSP-to-coin reduction.
3. Add an explicit `AC0[p]` coin-lower-bound contract layer and derive the
   corresponding MCSP threshold-oracle exclusion theorem surface.
4. Add a local-PRG transfer layer and derive counting-closed exclusion theorems
   for tree-MCSP threshold oracles.
5. Add a paper-facing local-PRG hardness-spec layer for published MCSP lower
   bounds.
6. Formalize a Williams-style SAT-algorithm-to-lower-bound schema.

Ultimate bridge target:

```text
MCSP ∉ PpolyDAG ⇒ NP ⊄ PpolyDAG ⇒ P ≠ NP
```

Honesty policy:

`pnp4` does not claim unconditional `P ≠ NP` unless it proves `MCSP ∉ PpolyDAG`
or another explicit `NP` language lower bound against `PpolyDAG` without hidden
assumptions.

Current reference point for the coin-problem track:

- Golovnev, Ilango, Impagliazzo, Kabanets, Kolokolova, Tal,
  `AC^0[p] Lower Bounds Against MCSP via the Coin Problem`, ICALP 2019 /
  ECCC 2019.

The current `pnp4` code only fixes the interface layer for that route.  It does
not yet claim the concentration, hybrid, or `AC^0[p]` lower-bound ingredients.

Current theorem surface status:

- `CoinProblem.lean`: exact finite-distribution semantics for the coin problem.
- `MCSPCoinReduction.lean`: threshold-oracle reduction surface from MCSP to coin
  distinguishing on truth tables.
- `AC0pCoinLowerBound.lean`: explicit contract layer for published `AC^0[p]`
  coin lower bounds, in size-bounded form.
- `MCSP_AC0p_Final.lean`: honest consequence layer saying that, under that
  contract and a concrete reduction witness, the corresponding MCSP threshold
  oracle cannot be implemented by the chosen `AC^0[p]` family model below the
  contract size threshold.
- `LocalPRG.lean`: truth-table local-PRG surface with easy-image and
  pseudorandomness interfaces against size-bounded circuit classes.
- `MCSP_LocalPRG_Transfer.lean`: proved Shannon-counting upper bound for
  uniform acceptance of exact tree-MCSP threshold oracles and the resulting
  local-PRG transfer contradiction theorem surface.
- `LocalPRGHardnessSpec.lean`: paper-facing published-route layer packaging
  `LocalPRGHardnessSpec`, target family models, and exact-threshold exclusion
  theorems for published local-PRG regimes.
