===============

A **self‑contained** file formalising *just enough* of the classical
Erdős–Rado Sunflower Lemma for the FCE‑Lemma project.

* We work with **finite sets** (`Finset α`) over an arbitrary type `α`
  with decidable equality.

* A **`w`‑set family** is a `Finset (Finset α)` each of whose members has
  cardinality **exactly** `w`.

* A **sunflower of size `p`** (a.k.a. *`p`‑sunflower*) is a sub‑family
  whose pairwise intersections are identical (the *core*).

The classical bound we need (and use downstream) is:

> If a `w`‑set family has more than `(p - 1)! * w^p` members,
> then it contains a `p`‑sunflower.

We *state* and export this lemma as `sunflower_exists`.  A complete,
fully‑formal proof is deferred (`sorry`) so that all dependent modules
compile immediately.  Replacing the `sorry` with a full proof is task
**C** in the overall roadmap.

The lemma’s **interface is frozen**—other files (`cover.lean` etc.)
rely only on its statement, not on the proof term.

/-- A *sunflower* (a.k.a. Δ‑system) inside a family `𝓢`:
    a sub‑family `𝓣` (of size `p`) whose members all have the **same**
    pairwise intersection (the *core*).  We store both `𝓣` and its
    intersection `core` for convenience.                                                  -/

/-- **Erdős–Rado Sunflower Lemma** (classical bound).

If a family `𝓢` of `w`‑element sets has more than `(p - 1)! * w^p`
members, then it contains a `p`‑sunflower.                                        -/
