cover_size.lean
================

Port of the legacy `CoverSize` module to the `Pnp2` namespace.
This file defines a minimal notion of cover size and proves a
simple cardinality bound using only elementary combinatorial facts.
The results are self‑contained and do not depend on the core
Family Collision–Entropy Lemma.

/-- A cover of dimension `n` is a finite set of subcubes. -/
abbrev Cover (n : ℕ) := Finset (Subcube n)

/-- The size of a cover is simply its cardinality. -/
def size {n : ℕ} (c : Cover n) : ℕ := c.card

/-! ### Monochromaticity of subcubes

We introduce a placeholder predicate `is_monochromatic`.  In this
minimal development a subcube is "monochromatic" if it has dimension
`0`.  This suffices for the counting lemmas below and matches the
behaviour of the historical version. -/

  s.dim = 0

  simpa [is_monochromatic, hs]

-- In this toy development we do not prove any meaningful
-- monochromaticity statement beyond the base case above.

/-- An explicit upper bound function used in the toy estimate. -/
def bound_function (n : ℕ) : ℕ := Fintype.card (Subcube n)

/-- Every cover has size at most `3^n`.  This follows from the fact that
there are exactly `3^n` subcubes of dimension `n`. -/
