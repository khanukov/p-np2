`familyCollisionEntropyCover` wraps the existential statement
`Cover2.cover_exists` for easier use in downstream files.  It asserts that a
family of Boolean functions with bounded collision entropy admits a small set of
subcubes that are monochromatic for every function in the family when inspected
pointwise.  The full proof is nontrivial and omitted; this declaration merely
re‑exports the existential lemma so that other parts of the development can rely
on it.

### A convenience record for covers returned by `familyEntropyCover`.
This bundles the list of rectangles together with proofs that each is
monochromatic for the whole family, that the rectangles cover all
`1`‑inputs, and an explicit bound on their number.  The size bound is
parametrised by `mBound n h`, the coarse upper estimate used throughout the
cover development.  An external arithmetic argument must establish that this
quantity indeed dominates the total number of subcubes; see
`coverFamily_card_le_mBound` for the combinatorial part of the story.

`familyEntropyCover` packages the canonical cover produced by `coverFamily` into
an explicit record exposing its basic properties.  The construction relies on
classical choice and is therefore non‑computable, but it provides a convenient
interface for downstream modules.

`familyEntropyCover` is defined using `cover_exists`, just like
`Cover2.coverFamily`.  The following lemma exposes this relationship by
identifying the set of rectangles produced by both constructions.
This convenience result simplifies linking the wrapper record with the
underlying cover used elsewhere in the development.

`entropyCover` translates a bound on the integer measure of `F` into an
explicit cover whose size does not exceed the total number of subcubes.  Each
subcube is monochromatic for every function in `F`, and together they cover all
`1`-inputs of the family.
