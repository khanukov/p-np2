 =====================

A formalisation of **Table Locality** (roadmap item B-2).
We show that small Boolean circuits depend only on a bounded set of
input bits.  The current lemma uses the trivial bound `k = n`, so the
chosen fragment is the entire input.  A sharper bound will require
further development, but the statement and proof are now complete and
available for use by later files.

### Locality property

We define `Local n k f` to mean the Boolean function `f : Point n → Bool` depends only on
some subset of at most `k` input bits. In other words, there is a set of input coordinates
of size ≤ k such that if two input points agree on all those coordinates, they have the same
output under `f`.

/-- A function `f : Point n → Bool` is *local* to at most `k` input bits
    if there exists a set of indices `S` (with `|S| ≤ k`) such that
    whenever two inputs coincide on all indices in `S`, they produce the same output. -/
class Local (n k : ℕ) (f : Point n → Bool) : Prop where
  support    : Finset (Fin n)              -- a set of input indices
  card_le    : support.card ≤ k            -- with size ≤ k
  depends_on : ∀ (x y : Point n),          -- such that if x and y agree on those indices,
                 (∀ i ∈ support, x i = y i) → f x = f y  -- then f x = f y

/-- **Table Locality** for small circuits (Lemma B‑2).
Any circuit of size `≤ n^c` can be rewritten so that its truth table depends only on
local fragments of the input (a bounded set of input bits). -/
